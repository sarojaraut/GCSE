## Six Mark Questions

1. A student titrates 25 cm³ of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) with sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The average titre is 24.5 cm³ of 0.1 mol/dm³ NaOH. The equation is H₂SO₄ + 2NaOH → Na₂SO₄ + 2H₂O. Calculate the concentration of the sulfuric acid. (6 marks)  
   **Answer:**  
   - Moles of NaOH = volume × concentration = 0.0245 dm³ × 0.1 mol/dm³ = 0.00245 moles  
   - From equation, 2 moles NaOH react with 1 mole H₂SO₄, so moles H₂SO₄ = 0.00245 / 2 = 0.001225 moles  
   - Volume of acid = 25 / 1000 = 0.025 dm³  
   - Concentration = 0.001225 / 0.025 = 0.049 mol/dm³

2. In a reaction, 10 g of calcium carbonate (CaCO₃) reacts with excess hydrochloric acid (HCl) to produce 4.4 g of carbon dioxide (CO₂). The equation is CaCO₃ + 2HCl → CaCl₂ + H₂O + CO₂. Calculate the percentage yield. (M_r CaCO₃=100, CO₂=44) (6 marks)  
   **Answer:**  
   - Moles CaCO₃ = 10 / 100 = 0.1 moles  
   - From equation, 1 mole CaCO₃ produces 1 mole CO₂, so expected moles CO₂ = 0.1  
   - Expected mass CO₂ = 0.1 × 44 = 4.4 g  
   - Actual mass = 4.4 g  
   - Percentage yield = (4.4 / 4.4) × 100 = 100%

   - Moles: C 52.2/12=4.35, H 13.0/1=13.0, O 34.8/16=2.175  
   - Divide by 2.175: C 2, H 6, O 1; empirical formula C₂H₆O  
   - Empirical M_r = 24 + 6 + 16 = 46; molecular formula = empirical formula = C₂H₆O

   **Answer:**  
   - Moles Mg = 5 / 24 = 0.2083 moles  
   - From equation, 2 moles Mg produce 2 moles MgO, so moles MgO = 0.2083  
   - Expected mass MgO = 0.2083 × 40 = 8.332 g  
   - Actual mass = 8.3 g  
   - Percentage yield = (8.3 / 8.332) × 100 ≈ 99.6%

5. Calculate the volume of hydrogen produced at STP when 2.4 g of magnesium reacts with excess hydrochloric acid. (Equation: Mg + 2HCl → MgCl₂ + H₂, A_r Mg=24) (6 marks)  
   **Answer:**  
   - Moles Mg = 2.4 / 24 = 0.1 moles  
   - From equation, 1 mole Mg produces 1 mole H₂, so moles H₂ = 0.1  
   - Volume at STP = 0.1 × 22.4 = 2.24 dm³

6. In a titration, 20 cm³ of potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution is neutralized by 15 cm³ of 0.2 mol/dm³ nitric acid (HNO₃). The equation is KOH + HNO₃ → KNO₃ + H₂O. Calculate the concentration of KOH. (6 marks)  
   **Answer:**  
   - Moles HNO₃ = 0.015 dm³ × 0.2 mol/dm³ = 0.003 moles  
   - From equation, 1:1 ratio, so moles KOH = 0.003 moles  
   - Volume KOH = 20 / 1000 = 0.02 dm³  
   - Concentration KOH = 0.003 / 0.02 = 0.15 mol/dm³
