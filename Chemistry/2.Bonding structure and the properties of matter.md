## Six Mark Questions

1. Describe the three states of matter and explain how the arrangement and movement of particles differ in each state. (6 marks)
   - **Answer:**
     - Solids: Particles are close together in a regular arrangement, vibrate in fixed positions, strong forces between particles.
     - Liquids: Particles are close together but in a random arrangement, can move past each other, moderate forces.
     - Gases: Particles are far apart in random arrangement, move quickly in all directions, weak forces between particles.
     - Differences in shape and volume: Solids have fixed shape and volume, liquids fixed volume but take shape of container, gases no fixed shape or volume.

2. Explain the differences between ionic, covalent and metallic bonding, giving examples and properties of each. (6 marks)
   - **Answer:**
     - Ionic bonding: Transfer of electrons between metal and non-metal (e.g., NaCl). High melting point, conduct when molten, brittle.
     - Covalent bonding: Sharing electrons between non-metals (e.g., CO2). Low melting point, don't conduct, soft.
     - Metallic bonding: Delocalized electrons in metal lattice (e.g., Cu). High melting point, conduct electricity, malleable.
     - Ionic compounds form crystals, covalent form molecules, metals form giant structures.

3. Describe the properties of substances and explain how they are related to their bonding and structure. (6 marks)
   - **Answer:**
     - Ionic compounds: High melting/boiling points due to strong electrostatic forces, conduct when molten/aqueous, soluble in water.
     - Simple molecular: Low melting/boiling points due to weak intermolecular forces, don't conduct, insoluble in water.
     - Giant covalent: High melting points, don't conduct (except graphite), hard (diamond) or soft (graphite).
     - Metals: High melting points, conduct electricity, malleable due to mobile electrons and sliding ions.
     - Properties determine uses: e.g., diamond for cutting tools, graphite for pencils and lubricants.
