## Three and Four Mark Questions

1. Describe how to make copper sulfate crystals from copper oxide and sulfuric acid. (4)  
**Answer: Add copper oxide to sulfuric acid, heat if necessary, filter to remove unreacted copper oxide, evaporate the solution to concentrate, leave to crystallize, filter and dry the crystals.**

2. Explain why aluminium is extracted by electrolysis rather than reduction with carbon. (3)  
**Answer: Aluminium is more reactive than carbon, so carbon cannot reduce aluminium oxide; Electrolysis is needed to break the strong bonds in aluminium oxide.**

**Answer: Equation: 2Mg + O2 → 2MgO**  
**Moles MgO = 24 / 40 = 0.6**  
**Moles Mg = 0.6**  
**Mass Mg = 0.6 * 24 = 14.4g**

4. Explain the difference between strong and weak acids. (4)  
**Answer: Strong acids ionize completely in water, weak acids partially; Strong acids have lower pH for same concentration; Strong acids conduct electricity better.**

**Answer: At cathode: hydrogen produced**  
**At anode: chlorine produced**  
**Sodium hydroxide remains in solution.**

6. Explain why carbon is used to extract iron but not aluminium. (4)  
**Answer: Iron is less reactive than carbon, so carbon can reduce iron oxide; Aluminium is more reactive, so electrolysis is used.**

7. Describe how to test for the presence of water. (4)  
**Answer: Use anhydrous copper sulfate, if it turns blue, water is present; Or use cobalt chloride paper, turns pink to blue.**

8. Calculate the concentration of sulfuric acid if 20cm3 neutralizes 0.01 moles of NaOH. (4)  
**Answer: Moles H2SO4 = 0.01 / 2 = 0.005**  
**Concentration = 0.005 / 0.02 = 0.25M**

9. Explain the term 'atom economy'. (4)  
**Answer: Atom economy is the percentage of atoms in reactants that end up in the desired product. High atom economy means less waste.**

10. Describe the extraction of iron from iron ore. (4)  
**Answer: Iron ore (haematite) is reduced with carbon in blast furnace at high temperature, producing iron and slag.**
