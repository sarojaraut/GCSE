Acids, alkalis and salts
    Acidic and alkaline solutions
        Acids
            Acids form acidic solutions in water. Acids produce hydrogen ions, H+ in aqueous solution. For example:
            HCl(aq) → H+(aq) + Cl-(aq)
            Acidic solutions have pH values less than 7.
        Alkalis
            Alkalis form alkaline solutions in water. Alkalis produce hydroxide ions, OH- in aqueous solution. For example:
                NaOH(aq) → Na+(aq) + OH-(aq)
            Alkaline solutions have pH values greater than 7.
        A neutral solution is neither acidic, nor alkaline. A neutral solution has a pH value of 7.

    Indicators and the pH scale
        The pH scale measures the acidity or alkalinity of a solution. 
        The pH of a solution can be measured using a pH probe, or estimated using universal indicator and a colour chart

Neutralisation
    Bases and alkalis
    A base is any substance that reacts with an acid to form a salt and water only. 
    This means that metal oxides and metal hydroxides are bases.

    Bases that are soluble in water are called alkalis and they dissolve in water to form alkaline solutions. 
    For example:
        copper oxide is a base, but it is not an alkali because it is insoluble in water
        sodium hydroxide is a base, and it dissolves in water so it is also an alkali

    Question
        Zinc oxide reacts with hydrochloric acid to form zinc chloride and water. Zinc oxide is insoluble in water. State and explain whether zinc oxide is a base, an alkali, or both.

        Base but not allaki
    Neutralisation reactions
        A neutralisation reaction is a reaction between an acid and a base. Remember:
            acids in solution are sources of hydrogen ions, H+
            alkalis in solution are sources of hydroxide ions, OH-
        In acid-alkali neutralisation reactions, hydrogen ions from the acid react with hydroxide ions from the alkali: H+(aq) + OH-(aq) → H2O(l)

        Pure water is neutral (its pH is 7).

Reactions of acids with metals
    When acids react with metals, the products are a salt and hydrogen. In general:
        Acid + metal → salt + hydrogen
        Hydrochloric acid + magnesium → magnesium chloride + hydrogen
        2HCl(aq) + Mg(s) → MgCl2(aq) + H2(g)

    Magnesium, zinc and iron also react with sulfuric acid. The products are a salt (in this case a sulfate) and hydrogen. For example: sulfuric acid + iron → iron(II) sulfate + hydrogen
        H2SO4(aq) + Fe(s) → FeSO4(aq) + H2(g)

    Explaining the reactions of acids with metals - Higher
        The reactions of acids with metals are redox reactions. For example, the ionic equation for the reaction of magnesium with hydrochloric acid is:
        2H+(aq) + Mg(s) → Mg2+(aq) + H2(g)
        This ionic equation can be split into two half equations:
            Mg(s) → Mg2+(aq) + 2e-(oxidation)
            2H+(aq) + 2e- → H2(g) (reduction)

    Use half equations to explain why the reaction of zinc with sulfuric acid is a redox reaction.

    H2SO4 + Zn -> ZnSO4 + H2

    Half Equation :

    Zn(s) -> Zn2-(aq) + 2e
    H2+(aq) + 2e -> H2(g)

Naming salts

    Acids are neutralised by bases, including alkalis, and by metal carbonates.

    Metal oxides are bases. In general, when an acid reacts with a metal oxide, the products are a salt and water.
        Acid + metal oxide → salt + water
        Sulfuric acid + copper oxide → copper sulfate + water
        H2SO4(aq) + CuO(s) → CuSO4(aq) + H2O(l)

    Alkalis are soluble bases. A salt and water are produced when acids react with alkalis. In general:
        Acid + alkali → salt + water
        For example:
            Nitric acid + sodium hydroxide → sodium nitrate + water
            HNO3(aq) + NaOH(aq) → NaNO3(aq) + H2O(l)
    Reactions with carbonates
        A salt, water and carbon dioxide are produced when acids react with carbonates. In general:
            Acid + carbonate → salt + water + carbon dioxide
            For example:
            Hydrochloric acid + copper carbonate → copper chloride + water + carbon dioxide
            2HCl(aq) + CuCO3(s) → CuCl2(aq) + H2O(l) + CO2(g)
    Naming salts
        The name of a salt has two parts. The first part comes from the base, alkali or metal carbonate. The second part comes from the acid:

        hydrochloric acid produces chloride salts
        nitric acid       produces nitrate salts
        sulfuric acid     produces sulfate salts

    Deducing the formulae of salts
        A salt has no overall charge, since the sum of the charges on their ions is equal to zero. The formulae of some common ions are given below:

        Charge on ion	Examples
            +1	            K+, Na+, Li+
            +2	            Mg2+, Ca2+, Cu2+, Fe2+
            +3	            Al3+, Fe3+
            -1	            Cl-, Br-, I-, NO3-
            -2	            SO42-
            -3	            PO43-

    Example
        What is the formula of aluminium sulfate?

        The formulae of the ions are Al3+ and SO42-.
        The sum of the charges on the ions in the neutral salt must be zero. Two Al3+ ions have a total charge of +6 and three SO42- ions have a total charge of -6.
        So the formula is Al2(SO4)3.

    What is the formula of magnesium chloride?
        MgCl2

Making soluble salts from insoluble Substance
    A soluble salt can be prepared by reacting an acid with a suitable insoluble reactant including:
        a metal
        a metal oxide
        a metal hydroxide
        a carbonate
    The insoluble reactant chosen depends upon the particular salt required.

    For example, copper does not react with dilute acids, so this metal cannot be used. On the other hand, sodium is too reactive to be used safely.

    As the reaction between metals and acids produces flammable hydrogen, chemists usually make salts by reacting a metal oxide or a metal carbonate with an acid.

    The table shows some examples of the salts produced by different combinations of insoluble reactants and acids.

                            Hydrochloric acid	   Sulfuric acid	    Nitric acid
    Copper oxide	        Copper chloride	       Copper sulfate	    Copper nitrate
    Aluminium hydroxide 	Aluminium chloride	   Aluminium sulfate	Aluminium nitrate
    Zinc carbonate	        Zinc chloride	       Zinc sulfate	        Zinc nitrate

    Making a salt
    To make a soluble salt from an acid and an insoluble reactant:

    Add powdered insoluble reactant to acid in a beaker, one spatula at a time, stirring to mix. Continue adding powder until it is in excess (some unreacted powder is left over). All the acid has now reacted.
    Filter the mixture in the beaker to remove the excess solid. The filtrate now contains only the salt and water.
    Heat the solution in an evaporating dish over a water bath. Stop heating when small crystals start to appear around the edge of the evaporating basin. The solution is now saturated.
    Leave the saturated solution at room temperature for a day or two. This gives time for large 
    crystalsto form. If necessary, dry the crystals by dabbing gently with filter paper

Concentrations and strengths of acids - Higher

    Dilute and concentrated solutions
        A solution forms when a solute dissolves in a solvent. 
        The concentration of a solution is a measure of how 'crowded' the solute particles are. 
        The more concentrated the solution, the more particles it contains in a given volume.

    When solutions are described as dilute or concentrated:

        a dilute solution contains a relatively small amount of dissolved solute
        a concentrated solution contains a relatively large amount of dissolved solute

    Strong and weak acids

        Acids in solution are a source of hydrogen ions, H+. The hydrogen ions are produced when the acid dissociates or breaks down to form ions.

        Strong acids
        Strong acids completely dissociate into ions in solution. 
        For example, hydrochloric acid is a strong acid. It ionises completely to form hydrogen ions and chloride ions:

        HCl(aq) → H+(aq) + Cl-(aq)

        Nitric acid and sulfuric acid are also strong acids.
    Weak acids
        Weak acids only partially dissociate in solution. For example, ethanoic acid is a weak acid. It is only partially ionised to form hydrogen ions and ethanoate ions:

        CH3COOH(aq) ⇌ H+(aq) + CH3COO-(aq)

        The ⇌ symbol is used in the equation to show that the reaction is a reversible reaction and does not go to completion.
    pH and hydrogen ion concentration
        The pH of a solution is a measure of its concentration of hydrogen ions:

        the higher the concentration of H+ ions in an acidic solution, the lower the pH
        the lower the concentration of H+ ions in an acidic solution, the higher the pH

        If the hydrogen ion concentration in a solution increases by a factor of 10, the pH of the solution decreases by 1 unit.

        pH of alkaline solutions
        The higher the concentration of OH- ions in an alkaline solution, the higher the pH.

        Question
            A solution of 1 g/dm3 hydrochloric acid has a pH of 1.6. Predict its pH when it is diluted to 0.1 g/dm3

            The hydrogen ion concentration decreases by a factor of 10, so the pH increases by 1 from 1.6 to 2.6.
        Question
        A solution of 2 g/dm3 hydrochloric acid has a pH of 1.3. Predict its pH when it is diluted to 0.02 g/dm3.

        The hydrogen ion concentration decreases by a factor of 100, so the pH increases by 2 from 1.3 to 3.3.
