Electrolysis

    Electrolytes
        Electrolytes are ionic compounds that are:
            in the molten state (heated so they become liquids), or
            dissolved in water

        Under these conditions, the ions in electrolytes are free to move within the liquid or solution.

        Electrolysis
            is a process in which electrical energy, from a direct current (dc) supply, breaks down electrolytes. 
            The free moving ions in electrolytes are attracted to the oppositely charged electrodes which connect to the dc supply.

    Products of electrolysis
        When ions reach an electrode, they gain or lose electrons. As a result, they form atoms or molecules of elements:

    Molten lead bromide, PbBr2(l), is an electrolyte. During electrolysis:
        Pb2+ ions gain electrons at the cathode and become Pb atoms
        Br- ions lose electrons at the anode and become Br atoms, which pair up to form Br2 molecules

Electrolysis of solutions
    Electrolysis of acidified waterWater is a poor conductor of electricity, but it does contain some hydrogen ions, H+, and hydroxide ions, OH-. 
    These ions are formed when a small proportion of water molecules naturally dissociate. If water is acidified with a little dilute sulfuric acid:

    H+ ions are attracted to the cathode, gain electrons and form hydrogen gas
    OH- ions are attracted to the anode, lose electrons and form oxygen gas

    Electrolysis of dissolved ionic compounds
        An electrolyte formed by dissolving an ionic compound contains:

            hydrogen ions from the water, and positive ions from the compound
            hydroxide ions from the water, and negative ions from the compound

        At the cathode : Whether hydrogen or a metal is produced at the cathode depends on the position of the metal in the metal reactivity series:
            the metal is produced at the cathode if it is less reactive than hydrogen
            hydrogen is produced at the cathode if the metal is more reactive than hydrogen
