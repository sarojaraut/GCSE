Titrations 
    The volumes of acids and alkali solutions that react with each other can be measured by titration using a suitable indicator.

    Making salts from acids and alkalis
        A soluble salt can be prepared by reacting an acid with a dilute solution of an alkali such as sodium hydroxide or ammonia. The main steps are:

            Carry out a titration. This is to determine the volumes of acid and alkali that must be mixed to obtain a solution containing only salt and water.
            Mix the acid and alkali in the correct proportions, as determined in step 1, but this time without including an indicator.
