THREE AND FOUR MARK QUESTIONS
================================================================================

1. Describe how the composition of the Earth's atmosphere has changed over time. (4 marks)
   Answer: The early atmosphere contained mainly carbon dioxide and water vapour. Photosynthesis by plants removed carbon dioxide and produced oxygen. This led to the current atmosphere with 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and small amounts of other gases including carbon dioxide.

2. Explain what the greenhouse effect is and why it is important. (4 marks)
   Answer: The greenhouse effect is the trapping of heat in the Earth's atmosphere by greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane and water vapour. These gases allow sunlight to pass through but absorb and re-emit infrared radiation, keeping the Earth warm enough for life. Without it, Earth would be too cold.

3. Describe how human activities contribute to global warming. (4 marks)
   Answer: Human activities release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Burning fossil fuels for energy and transport produces carbon dioxide. Deforestation reduces the removal of carbon dioxide by plants. Agriculture produces methane from livestock. These gases trap more heat, causing global warming.

4. Explain how acid rain forms and its effects. (4 marks)
   Answer: Acid rain forms when sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from burning fossil fuels react with water vapour in the atmosphere to form acids. These fall as rain, snow or dry deposition. Acid rain damages buildings, kills aquatic life in lakes, and harms forests by leaching nutrients from soil.

5. Describe the role of the ozone layer in protecting life on Earth. (3 marks)
   Answer: The ozone layer is a region in the upper atmosphere containing ozone (O3) molecules. It absorbs harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun, preventing it from reaching Earth's surface where it could cause skin cancer and damage ecosystems.

MATHS QUESTIONS
================================================================================

1. The atmosphere contains 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen and 1% other gases. Calculate the percentage of nitrogen and oxygen together. (1 mark)
   Answer: 78% + 21% = 99%

2. A sample of air has a volume of 100 cm³. If 78% is nitrogen, calculate the volume of nitrogen. (2 marks)
   Answer: 78% of 100 = 78 cm³

3. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is 0.04%. Express this as a decimal. (1 mark)
   Answer: 0.04% = 0.0004

4. A car produces 120 g of CO₂ per kilometre. Calculate the CO₂ produced for a 500 km journey. (2 marks)
   Answer: 120 × 500 = 60,000 g = 60 kg

5. The Earth's atmosphere has a mass of approximately 5.15 × 10^18 kg. If 0.04% is CO₂, calculate the mass of CO₂. (3 marks)
   Answer: 0.0004 × 5.15 × 10^18 = 2.06 × 10^15 kg

6. A power station burns coal containing 3% sulphur. If it burns 1000 tonnes of coal, calculate the mass of sulphur dioxide produced (assuming complete conversion). (Relative atomic masses: S=32, O=16) (4 marks)
   Answer: Mass of sulphur = 3% of 1000 tonnes = 30 tonnes
   Moles of S = 30,000,000 g / 32 = 937,500 moles
   SO₂ produced = 937,500 moles
   Mass of SO₂ = 937,500 × (32 + 32) = 937,500 × 64 = 60,000,000 g = 60 tonnes

SIX MARK QUESTIONS
================================================================================

1. Evaluate the evidence for changes in the Earth's atmosphere over time. (6 marks)
   Answer: Evidence comes from studying rocks and ice cores. Sedimentary rocks show iron compounds that could only form in an oxygen-free atmosphere, suggesting early atmosphere lacked oxygen. Fossil evidence shows early life forms were anaerobic. Ice cores from Antarctica show CO₂ levels were much higher in the past (up to 2000 ppm) compared to pre-industrial levels of 280 ppm. The presence of banded iron formations indicates oxygen levels increased dramatically around 2 billion years ago due to photosynthesis. This evidence supports the theory that the atmosphere evolved from CO₂-rich to oxygen-rich through biological processes.

2. Discuss the causes and consequences of global warming. (6 marks)
   Answer: Global warming is caused by increased greenhouse gas concentrations, mainly CO₂ from burning fossil fuels (78% of emissions), deforestation reducing carbon sinks, and methane from agriculture and waste. Natural causes include volcanic activity and solar variations, but human activities are the main driver. Consequences include rising sea levels from melting ice caps, more extreme weather events, ocean acidification affecting marine life, changes in agricultural patterns, and increased spread of diseases. Mitigation strategies include reducing emissions through renewable energy, carbon capture, reforestation, and international agreements like the Paris Accord.

3. Explain how air pollution affects human health and the environment. (6 marks)
   Answer: Air pollutants include particulate matter (PM), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulphur dioxide (SO₂), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O₃). Particulate matter can penetrate lungs causing respiratory problems, heart disease, and premature death. NOx and SO₂ contribute to acid rain which damages buildings, forests, and aquatic ecosystems. Ozone at ground level irritates lungs and eyes. CO binds to haemoglobin reducing oxygen transport. Long-term exposure increases cancer risk and affects children's development. Environmental impacts include reduced visibility, crop damage, and ecosystem disruption. Solutions include cleaner fuels, catalytic converters, and emission controls.

4. Describe the formation and importance of the ozone layer. (6 marks)
   Answer: The ozone layer forms in the stratosphere through photochemical reactions. UV radiation breaks O₂ molecules into oxygen atoms, which combine with O₂ to form O₃. This process is catalysed by pollutants like CFCs which destroy ozone. The ozone layer is crucial as it absorbs 97-99% of harmful UV-B and UV-C radiation, preventing skin cancer, cataracts, and immune system damage. It also protects marine ecosystems and reduces UV damage to crops. The Montreal Protocol successfully phased out CFCs, allowing ozone recovery. However, climate change may affect ozone depletion patterns. The ozone layer demonstrates how human activities can damage but also repair atmospheric systems.

5. Analyse the advantages and disadvantages of fractional distillation of air. (6 marks)
   Answer: Advantages: Produces pure gases like nitrogen, oxygen, argon for industrial use. Oxygen for medical purposes and steelmaking. Nitrogen for food preservation and electronics manufacturing. Argon for welding and light bulbs. Economically viable as air is free. Disadvantages: Energy-intensive process requiring cooling to -200°C. High capital and operating costs. Produces large volumes of waste gases. Environmental impact from energy consumption contributing to climate change. Safety risks from handling cryogenic liquids. Limited by air composition - can't produce gases not present in air. Overall, benefits outweigh disadvantages for essential industrial gases, but sustainable energy sources needed to reduce environmental impact.
