    Multiple choice questions

        Figure 1 shows the structure of an element. What is the name of this element? Graphite
        Why does the element in figure 1 conduct electricity? It has delocalised electrons
        shows some boiling point data. Which statement explains the data in the table?
            The intermolecular forces between the molecules in methane are weaker than the intermolecular forces between the molecules in water. IN small molecules it's the inter molecular force that decides the melting point and boiling pint but giant covalent molecules it's strong covalent bond that decides the melting point and boiling point
        Which statement describes a limitation of the particle model?
            In the model there are no forces between particles

Six Mark Questions
    The table shows the ability of different substances to conduct electricity.

        solid calcium chloride contains ions/cations/anions which are charged particles
        solid calcium chloride does not conduct because charged particles are not free to move because they are held together by strong electrostatic forces/ionic bonds in lattice
        molten calcium chloride conducts because ions/cations/anions are present which are charged particles and are free to move
        the ions have separated, and move to the electrode of opposite charge
        diamond does not conduct because it is a giant molecular covalent structure with no free electrons
        outer electrons of carbon atoms are used in bonding
        zinc metallic structure consists of delocalised free electrons which can move between layers of metals atoms/cations

        particles in solids are close together and regularly arranged
        particles in solids vibrate about fixed positions
        particles in liquids are close together and randomly arranged
        particles in liquids move around each other
        particles in gases are far apart and randomly arranged
        during boiling, energy is transferred to particles
        bonds/forces of attraction between particles break/are overcome

    The table shows the melting points of different substances.
        sodium chloride contains ions in a regular lattice

    The kinetic particle theory describes the arrangement, movement and relative energy of particles in the three states of matter.
    Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of this model.

    Strengths include:
        particles in solids and liquids are shown close together, but far apart in gases
        particles in solids are shown regularly arranged, but randomly arranged in liquids and gases
    Weaknesses include:
        particles are shown in 2D only (and not in 3D)
        particles in gases are too close together
        the model is static/not moving
