Nanoscience
    Nanoparticles
    Nanoscience is the study of structures that are between 1 and 100 nanometres (nm) in size. 
    Most nanoparticles are made up of a few hundred atoms.

    Surface area to volume ratios
        Nanoparticles have very large surface area to volume ratios compared to the same material in bulk, as powders, lumps or sheets.

    Nanoparticulate materials
        A substance that consists of nanoparticles is described as being nanoparticulate.

    Properties and uses
        Nanoparticulate materials have many uses. These include:

        medical treatments
        cosmetics, deodorants and sunscreens
        electronics
        catalysts

    Small sizes
        Sunscreens block harmful ultraviolet light from the sun reaching the skin. Zinc oxide blocks ultraviolet light, so is used in sunscreens. Bulk zinc oxide is white, but nanoparticulate zinc oxide is invisible on the skin. Many people prefer nanoparticulate sunscreen for this reason.

        Self-cleaning window panes have nanoparticulate coatings. These catalyse the breakdown of dirt in the presence of sunlight.
