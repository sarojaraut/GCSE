Ionic compounds

Forming ions
    An ion is an atom or group of atoms with a positive or negative charge. Ions form when atoms lose or gain electrons to obtain a full outer shell:
        metal atoms lose electrons to form positively charged ions (because more proton than electron)
        non-metal atoms gain electrons to form negatively charged ions
        the ions formed have full outer shells
Forming ionic bonds
    Positive and negative ions form when a metal reacts with a non-metal, by transferring electrons. The oppositely charged ions are strongly attracted to each other, forming ionic bonds.

Dot and cross diagrams
    when sodium reacts with chlorine, electrons transfer from sodium atoms to chlorine atoms. The diagrams show two ways of representing this electron transfer.
    Sodium electrons are in dot and Chlorine the electrons are shown as cross.

Conducting electricity
    A substance can conduct electricity if:it contains charged particles, such as ions, andthese particles are free to move from place to place
