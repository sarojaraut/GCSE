The three states of matter

Solids, liquids and gases
    The kinetic particle theory of matter is a model that describes the arrangement, movement and energy of particles in a substance. 
    The model is used to explain the physical properties of solids, liquids and gases.

    Solids:
        have a fixed shape and cannot flow, because their particles cannot move from place to place
        cannot be compressed (squashed), because their particles are close together and have no space to move into
    Liquids:
        flow and take the shape of their container, because their particles can move around each other
        cannot be compressed, because their particles are close together and have no space to move into
    Gases:
        flow and completely fill their container, because their particles can move quickly in all directions
        can be compressed, because their particles are far apart and have space to move into
Changes of state

    Solid  <-> liquid (melt, freeze)
    Liquid <-> gas (boil, condense)
    Some substances can change directly from solid to gas without becoming a liquid in between. This is called sublimation, Solid carbon dioxide ('dry ice') can sublime

Explaining change of state
    Melting, evaporating and boiling
    Energy must be transferred, by heating, to a substance for these changes of state to happen. During these changes the particles gain energy to break some of the bonds between particles during melting and 

    Given temperature < melting point	Solid
    Given temperature is between melting and boiling points	Liquid
    Given temperature > boiling point	Gas
