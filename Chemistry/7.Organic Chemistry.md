## Six Mark Questions

### Question 51 (6 marks)
Describe the differences between alkanes and alkenes, including their structures, properties and reactions. Use examples to illustrate your answer.

**Answer: Alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons with the general formula CnH2n+2. They have single bonds between carbon atoms and are relatively unreactive. For example, methane (CH4) and ethane (C2H6). Alkenes are unsaturated hydrocarbons with the general formula CnH2n. They contain at least one double bond between carbon atoms, making them more reactive. For example, ethene (C2H4) and propene (C3H6).

Alkanes undergo substitution reactions, such as with chlorine in the presence of UV light. Alkenes undergo addition reactions, such as with bromine water or hydrogen.

Alkanes are used as fuels because they burn to produce energy. Alkenes are used to make polymers through addition polymerisation.**

### Question 52 (6 marks)
Explain how ethanol can be produced by fermentation and by hydration of ethene. Include the conditions required and compare the two methods.

**Answer: Fermentation: Yeast enzymes convert sugars (like glucose) into ethanol and carbon dioxide in anaerobic conditions. The reaction is: C6H12O6 → 2C2H5OH + 2CO2. It occurs at around 30-40°C and takes several days. The ethanol concentration is limited to about 15% because higher concentrations kill the yeast.

Hydration of ethene: Ethene reacts with steam in the presence of phosphoric acid catalyst at 300°C and 60-70 atm pressure. The reaction is: C2H4 + H2O → C2H5OH. This produces pure ethanol which can be concentrated further.

Fermentation uses renewable resources (sugars from plants) and is more environmentally friendly, but slower and produces dilute ethanol. Hydration uses ethene from cracking of hydrocarbons (fossil fuels) and produces concentrated ethanol quickly.**

### Question 53 (6 marks)
Describe the reactions of carboxylic acids and explain their acidic properties. Use ethanoic acid as an example.

**Answer: Carboxylic acids contain the -COOH functional group and are weak acids. They partially ionise in water: CH3COOH ⇌ CH3COO- + H+. This means they have a higher pH than strong acids and react less vigorously.

They react with metals to produce hydrogen gas and a salt: 2CH3COOH + Mg → (CH3COO)2Mg + H2.

They react with carbonates to produce carbon dioxide: 2CH3COOH + Na2CO3 → 2CH3COONa + H2O + CO2.

They react with bases to form salts and water: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O.

They undergo esterification with alcohols: CH3COOH + C2H5OH → CH3COOC2H5 + H2O.

Their acidic properties are due to the ability of the -COOH group to donate a proton, but the equilibrium lies to the left because the carboxylate ion is stabilised by resonance.**

### Question 54 (6 marks)
Explain the process of addition polymerisation and condensation polymerisation. Give examples and compare the two processes.

**Answer: Addition polymerisation involves unsaturated monomers (alkenes) joining together without losing any atoms. The double bond in the monomer opens up and forms single bonds with adjacent monomers. For example, ethene (C2H4) polymerises to form polyethene (C2H4)n. No other products are formed, and the empirical formula remains the same.

Condensation polymerisation involves monomers with two functional groups joining together with the loss of a small molecule, usually water. For example, ethanoic acid and ethanol form ethyl ethanoate and water. The polymer has a different empirical formula from the monomers.

Addition polymers are generally thermoplastic and can be melted and remoulded. Condensation polymers like polyesters and polyamides are often thermosetting and more rigid.

Addition polymerisation requires high pressure and temperature, or catalysts. Condensation polymerisation also requires heat and sometimes catalysts.

Both processes produce long chain molecules, but addition polymers are from one type of monomer, while condensation polymers are from two different monomers.**

### Question 55 (6 marks)
Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using biofuels compared to fossil fuels. Use ethanol as an example of a biofuel.

**Answer: Biofuels like ethanol are produced from renewable sources such as sugar cane or corn through fermentation. Fossil fuels like petrol are non-renewable and will eventually run out.

Biofuels are carbon neutral because the carbon dioxide released when burned is balanced by the carbon dioxide absorbed during plant growth. Fossil fuels release carbon dioxide that has been locked away for millions of years, contributing to global warming.

Biofuels can be produced locally, reducing dependence on imported oil. However, growing crops for biofuels can compete with food production and lead to deforestation.

Ethanol has a lower energy density than petrol, so more volume is needed for the same energy output. It can also cause engine corrosion if not blended properly.

Fossil fuels are cheaper and more energy dense, but their extraction and use cause environmental damage and contribute to climate change.

Overall, biofuels offer a more sustainable alternative but have limitations in terms of energy efficiency and land use.**

### Question 56 (6 marks)
Explain how the structure of organic molecules affects their properties and reactivity. Use alkanes, alkenes, alcohols and carboxylic acids as examples.

**Answer: The structure of organic molecules determines their physical and chemical properties.

Alkanes have single bonds between carbon atoms and are saturated. This makes them relatively unreactive and they undergo substitution reactions slowly. They have low boiling points for their size due to weak intermolecular forces.

Alkenes have double bonds and are unsaturated. The double bond makes them more reactive, undergoing addition reactions readily. They can be used to make polymers.

Alcohols contain the -OH functional group. This makes them polar and able to form hydrogen bonds, giving them higher boiling points than similar alkanes. The -OH group allows them to undergo oxidation reactions.

Carboxylic acids have the -COOH group, which can ionise to release H+ ions, making them acidic. They can form hydrogen bonds and have higher boiling points. They undergo reactions typical of acids and can form esters.

The functional groups determine the reactivity: alkanes are inert, alkenes are reactive due to double bonds, alcohols and acids are reactive due to -OH and -COOH groups.

Chain length affects physical properties: longer chains have higher boiling points and are less volatile.

Branching affects properties: branched alkanes have lower boiling points than straight-chain isomers.**

### Question 57 (6 marks)
Describe the environmental impact of polymers and suggest ways to reduce their impact.

**Answer: Polymers are widely used because they are cheap, durable and versatile. However, most polymers are not biodegradable and persist in the environment for hundreds of years. This leads to accumulation of plastic waste in landfills and oceans.

Plastic waste can harm wildlife: animals may ingest plastics or become entangled. Microplastics enter the food chain and may affect human health.

Polymers are made from non-renewable fossil fuels, contributing to climate change through extraction and processing.

Ways to reduce impact:
1. Reduce: Use less plastic, choose products with less packaging.
2. Reuse: Wash and reuse plastic items.
3. Recycle: Sort plastics for recycling, though not all types can be recycled effectively.
4. Biodegradable alternatives: Use polymers that break down naturally, like PLA from corn starch.
5. Compostable plastics: These break down in industrial composting facilities.
6. Better waste management: Improve collection and processing of plastic waste.
7. Design for recycling: Create products that are easier to recycle.

Governments can introduce legislation to ban single-use plastics and promote recycling. Individuals can make conscious choices to reduce plastic consumption.**

### Question 58 (6 marks)
Explain the importance of organic chemistry in everyday life and industry.

**Answer: Organic chemistry is crucial because carbon compounds form the basis of life and many materials we use.

In medicine: Many drugs are organic compounds, like aspirin (from salicylic acid) and paracetamol. Understanding organic reactions helps in drug synthesis and development.

In food: Organic compounds like carbohydrates, proteins and fats are essential nutrients. Food additives and preservatives are organic chemicals.

In materials: Polymers like polyethene for plastic bags, polyester for clothing, PVC for pipes. These are all organic polymers.

In fuels: Petrol, diesel and biofuels are organic compounds. Understanding combustion helps in engine design and alternative fuel development.

In agriculture: Pesticides, herbicides and fertilisers are organic compounds. Understanding their properties ensures effective and safe use.

In everyday products: Soaps, detergents, cosmetics, dyes and paints all contain organic compounds.

Organic chemistry enables the synthesis of new materials with specific properties, like stronger polymers or more effective drugs. It also helps in understanding environmental issues, like the impact of pollutants and greenhouse gases.

Overall, organic chemistry improves quality of life through better materials, medicines and understanding of biological processes.**
