Balanced chemical equations
A balanced chemical equation represents a chemical reaction using the formulae of the reactants and products. It shows the number of units of each substance involved.

H2O(l) is liquid water but H2O(g) is steam and H2O(s) is ice
Balancing an equation
The law of conservation of mass states that no atoms are lost or made during a chemical reaction, so the total mass of the products is equal to the total mass of the reactants.

N2 + H2 → NH3 After balancing N2 + 3H2 → 2NH3

Add the state symbols if asked to do so.	N2(g) + 3H2(g) → 2NH3(g)
