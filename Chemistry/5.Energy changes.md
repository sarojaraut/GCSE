### Three and Four Mark Questions

1. **Explain why exothermic reactions are useful in everyday life. Give two examples.** (3 marks)  
    **Answer:** Exothermic reactions release heat energy, making them useful for heating. Examples: combustion of fuels in car engines for propulsion and heat; hand warmers using oxidation reactions to provide warmth.

2. **Describe the energy changes that occur during an endothermic reaction, including what happens to the surroundings.** (3 marks)  
    **Answer:** In an endothermic reaction, energy is taken in from the surroundings to break bonds in reactants. This causes the temperature of the surroundings to decrease. The products have more energy than the reactants.

3. **Explain the difference between activation energy and enthalpy change in a reaction.** (4 marks)  
    **Answer:** Activation energy is the minimum energy needed to start a reaction by breaking bonds in reactants. Enthalpy change (ΔH) is the overall energy difference between reactants and products. Activation energy is a barrier that must be overcome, while ΔH shows whether the reaction is exothermic (negative ΔH) or endothermic (positive ΔH).

4. **Describe how a simple chemical cell works. Include the roles of electrodes and electrolyte.** (4 marks)  
    **Answer:** A chemical cell has two electrodes (anode and cathode) connected by an electrolyte. At the anode, oxidation occurs (loss of electrons). At the cathode, reduction occurs (gain of electrons). The electrolyte allows ions to move, completing the circuit and allowing current to flow, converting chemical energy to electrical energy.

5. **Explain why bond making is exothermic.** (3 marks)  
    **Answer:** When bonds form between atoms, energy is released as the atoms become more stable in their bonded state. This energy is given out to the surroundings, making bond formation exothermic.

6. **Compare fuel cells and batteries in terms of energy production and sustainability.** (4 marks)  
    **Answer:** Both convert chemical energy to electrical energy. Batteries store chemicals internally and produce electricity until chemicals are depleted. Fuel cells continuously produce electricity as long as fuel (e.g., hydrogen) is supplied. Fuel cells are more sustainable as they don't need recharging and produce water as waste, while batteries may contain toxic materials and need disposal.

### Maths Questions

1. **Calculate the enthalpy change for the reaction: H₂(g) + ½O₂(g) → H₂O(g)**  
    Given: H-H bond energy = 436 kJ/mol, O=O bond energy = 496 kJ/mol, O-H bond energy = 463 kJ/mol. (3 marks)  
    **Answer:**  
    Energy in (bonds broken): H-H = 436 kJ, ½ × O=O = 248 kJ, Total = 684 kJ  
    Energy out (bonds formed): 2 × O-H = 926 kJ  
    ΔH = 684 - 926 = -242 kJ/mol

    **Answer:** Energy change = (2 × 412) - 743 = 824 - 743 = +81 kJ

3. **In a reaction, 500 kJ of energy is released when 2 moles of reactant are used. Calculate the enthalpy change per mole.** (2 marks)  
    **Answer:** ΔH = -500 kJ / 2 mol = -250 kJ/mol

4. **The activation energy for a reaction is 150 kJ/mol and the enthalpy change is -100 kJ/mol. Calculate the energy of the products relative to reactants.** (3 marks)  
    **Answer:** Products are at lower energy than reactants by 100 kJ/mol (since ΔH = -100 kJ/mol).

5. **A fuel cell produces 1.5 V and delivers 0.5 A for 10 minutes. Calculate the energy produced in joules.** (3 marks)  
    **Answer:** Power = 1.5 V × 0.5 A = 0.75 W  
    Time = 10 × 60 = 600 s  
    Energy = 0.75 W × 600 s = 450 J

6. **Calculate the enthalpy change for: CH₄(g) + 2O₂(g) → CO₂(g) + 2H₂O(g)**  
    Given: C-H = 412 kJ/mol, O=O = 496 kJ/mol, C=O = 743 kJ/mol, O-H = 463 kJ/mol. (4 marks)  
    **Answer:**  
    Bonds broken: 4 × C-H = 1648 kJ, 2 × O=O = 992 kJ, Total = 2640 kJ  
    Bonds formed: 2 × C=O = 1486 kJ, 4 × O-H = 1852 kJ, Total = 3338 kJ  
    ΔH = 2640 - 3338 = -698 kJ/mol

### Six Mark Questions

1. **Explain the energy changes in exothermic and endothermic reactions, using energy level diagrams. Include examples and discuss the factors affecting reaction rates.** (6 marks)  
    **Answer:** Exothermic reactions release energy, shown by products at lower energy than reactants on a diagram. Endothermic reactions absorb energy, with products higher than reactants. Examples: exothermic - combustion; endothermic - thermal decomposition. Activation energy affects rates - higher activation energy means slower reaction unless temperature increases to provide more kinetic energy for collisions.

2. **Describe how bond energies are used to calculate enthalpy changes in reactions. Explain why some reactions are exothermic while others are endothermic, using examples.** (6 marks)  
    **Answer:** Enthalpy change = energy to break bonds in reactants - energy released forming bonds in products. If more energy is released forming bonds than used breaking them, reaction is exothermic (e.g., combustion). If more energy is used breaking bonds, it's endothermic (e.g., photosynthesis). This relates to stability - stronger bonds in products make exothermic reactions more likely.

3. **Evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of using chemical cells and fuel cells for energy production. Discuss their environmental impact and applications.** (6 marks)  
    **Answer:** Chemical cells (batteries) are portable and rechargeable but contain toxic materials and limited lifespan. Fuel cells provide continuous power with high efficiency and only water as waste, making them environmentally friendly. However, they require pure fuels like hydrogen. Applications: batteries in devices; fuel cells in vehicles. Environmental impact: fuel cells reduce greenhouse gases compared to fossil fuels.

4. **Explain the role of activation energy in chemical reactions. Discuss how catalysts affect energy changes and reaction rates, with reference to energy level diagrams.** (6 marks)  
    **Answer:** Activation energy is the energy barrier reactants must overcome. Catalysts lower this barrier by providing alternative pathways, increasing reaction rates without being consumed. On diagrams, catalysts create lower energy pathways. This allows reactions at lower temperatures, saving energy and making processes more efficient, such as in industrial catalysis.

5. **Analyse the energy changes in the electrolysis of water. Explain why this process is endothermic and discuss its applications in energy storage.** (6 marks)  
    **Answer:** Electrolysis requires electrical energy input to break water into hydrogen and oxygen, making it endothermic. Energy is used to overcome bond energies in water molecules. Applications include hydrogen production for fuel cells, enabling energy storage by converting electrical energy to chemical energy in hydrogen, which can be stored and later converted back to electricity, supporting renewable energy systems.
