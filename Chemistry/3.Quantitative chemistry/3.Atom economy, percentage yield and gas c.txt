Atom economy, percentage yield and gas calculations

Atom economy
    No atoms are gained or lost in a chemical reaction. However, some atoms in the reactants may not end up in the desired product. They instead form other products, and so are regarded as by-products.

    For example, hydrogen can be manufactured by reacting methane with steam:
        methane + steam → hydrogen + carbon monoxide
        CH4(g) + H2O(g) → 3H2(g) + CO(g)
        In this reaction, carbon and oxygen atoms in the reactants do not form the useful product. Carbon monoxide is a waste gas.

    The atom economy of a reaction is a measure of the amount of starting materials that end up as useful products. 
    It is important for sustainable development and for economic reasons to use reactions with high atom economy.

    Calculating percentage atom economy => 
    atom economy = (Total molecular mass of desired products / Total molecular mass of reactant products) * 100

    Hydrogen can be manufactured by reacting methane with steam:

    CH4(g) + H2O(g) → 3H2(g) + CO(g)

    Calculate the atom economy for the reaction. (Ar of H = 1, Ar of C = 12, Ar of O = 16)

    total Mr of reactants = 16 + 18 = 34 and total Mr of desired product = 3 × 2 = 6
    atom economy = 6/34 * 100 = 17.6%

    Q2: Ethanol, CH3CH2OH, can be produced by the fermentation of glucose, C6H12O6:

    C6H12O6(aq) → 2CH3CH2OH(aq) + 2CO2(g)

    Calculate the atom economy for the reaction. (Mr of C6H12O6 = 180, Mr of CH3CH2OH = 46)
    atom economy = (2*46 /180) *100 = 51.1%

Percentage yield
The theoretical yield is the maximum possible mass of a product that can be made in a chemical reaction.

It can be calculated from:
the balanced equation
the mass and relative formula mass of the limiting reactant 
the relative formula mass of the product

percentage yield = (mass of actual product made / maximum theoritical mass of product) * 100

Copper oxide reacts with sulfuric acid to make copper sulfate and water. In an experiment, 1.6 g of dry copper sulfate crystals are made. If the theoretical yield is 2.0 g, calculate the percentage yield of copper sulfate.

Percentage yield = 1.6 /2.0 * 100  = 80%

Choosing reaction pathways - Higher
    Usually, there is more than one way to make a particular substance. 
    A reaction pathway describes the sequence of reactions needed to produce a desired product. 
    The pathway chosen for a product depends on factors such as:
        percentage yield
        atom economy rate of reaction
        equilibrium position
        usefulness of by-products

Avogadro's law - Higher
    Avogadro's law states that when the temperature and pressure stay the same:
    equal volumes of different gases contain an equal number of molecules

    This means that equal amounts in moles of gases occupy the same volume under the same conditions of temperature and pressure. For example:
        1 mol of hydrogen gas occupies the same volume as 1 mol of methane gas
        10 mol of nitrogen monoxide gas occupy the same volume as 10 mol of argon gas

    Hydrogen reacts with chlorine to form hydrogen chloride:

    H2(g) + Cl2(g) → 2HCl(g)

    The mole ratio of hydrogen to chlorine is 1:1. This means, for example, that in terms of volume:
        1 cm3 of hydrogen reacts exactly with 1 cm3 of chlorine
    The mole ratio of hydrogen to hydrogen chloride is 1:2. This means, for example:
        1 cm3 of hydrogen produces 2 cm3 of hydrogen chloride

    Question
        Nitrogen reacts with hydrogen to produce ammonia:
        N2(g) + 3H2(g) → 2NH3(g)
        Calculate the volume of ammonia that can be produced from 150 cm3 of hydrogen and an excess of nitrogen.

        The mole ratio of hydrogen to ammonia is 3:2
        Volume of ammonia = 150/3 * 2 = 100cm3

    Question
        Hydrogen reacts with oxygen to produce steam:
        2H2(g) + O2(g) → 2H2O(g)
        Calculate the volume of steam that can be produced from 50 cm3 of oxygen and an excess of hydrogen.

        The mole ratio of oxygen to steam is 1:2
        So, Volume of steam produced = 100 cm3

    Molar gas volume - Higher
        At a given temperature and pressure, one mole of any gas occupies the same volume:
        the molar volume is the volume occupied by one mole of any gas, at room temperature and pressure

        The volume of a known amount of gas can be calculated: Volume = amount in mol × molar volume
        Question
            Calculate the volume of 0.25 mol of hydrogen at room temperature and pressure. (Molar volume = 24 dm3)
            volume = amount in mol × molar volume
                volume = 0.25 × 24 = 6 dm3

        Calculating the amount of a gas
            The amount of a known volume of gas can be calculated: Amount in mol  = volume / molar volume

Calculations involving molar volume - Higher
    The molar volume can be used in calculations involving the masses of solids, and volumes of gases, in reactions.

    Calculating a volume from a mass
        Worked example
        4.6 g of sodium reacts completely with excess water:
        2Na(s) + 2H2O(l) → 2NaOH(aq) + H2(g)
        Calculate the volume of hydrogen produced. (Ar of Na = 23, molar volume = 24 dm3)

        Step 1 - Calculate the amount of sodium in moles
            Amount in mol = mass/ atomic mass = 4.6/23 = 0.20 Mol
            Amount of sodium = 0.20 mol

        Step 2 - Find the amount of hydrogen in moles
            From the  balanced equation, the mole ratio Na:H2 is 2:1
            Therefore 0.20 mol of Na produces = 0.10 mol of H2

        Step 3 - Calculate the volume of hydrogen
            Volume = amount in mol × molar volume
            Volume = 0.10 × 24 = 2.4 dm3

    Question
    Calcium carbonate decomposes to form calcium oxide and carbon dioxide when it is heated:
    CaCO3(s) → CaO(s) + CO2(g)
    Calculate the volume of carbon dioxide produced from completely decomposing 1.0 g of calcium carbonate. (Mr of CaCO3 = 100, molar volume = 24,000 cm3)

    Volume taken by 1 mole of any gas = 24,000 cm3
    From the balanced equation mole ratio of calcium carbonate to carbon dioxide is 1:1

    Amount (in mole)for 1.0 g of calcium carbonate = 1/100 = 0.01 Mole
    So 0.01 Mole of calcium carbonate would produce 0.01 Mole carbon dioxide
    Volume taken by 0.01 Mole carbon dioxide = 0.01 * 24000 cm3 = 240cm3

    Calculating a mass from a volume
    Worked example
    Lithium hydroxide absorbs carbon dioxide from the air:
    2LiOH(s) + CO2(g) → Li2CO3(s) + H2O(l)
    Calculate the mass of lithium hydroxide needed to absorb 12 dm3 of carbon dioxide. (Mr of LiOH = 24, molar volume = 24 dm3)

        Volume of carbon dioxide to be absored is 12 dm3
        Amount of carbon dioxide in mole = 12/12 = 0.5 Mole
        From the balanced equation Mole ratio of lithium hydroxide and carbon dioxide is 2:1
        that means to absorb 0.5 Mole of carbon dioxide, 1 Mole of lithium hydroxide would be needed
        Mass of lithium hydroxide needed is = 1 * 24 = 24 gm

    Question
    Sodium reacts with chlorine to produce sodium chloride:
    2Na(s) + Cl2(g) → 2NaCl(s)
    Calculate the mass of sodium chloride produced from 960 cm3 of chlorine and an excess of sodium. (Mr of NaCl = 58.5, molar volume = 24,000 cm3 )

    Amount of 960 cm3 of chlorine = 960/24,000 = 0.04 Mole
    Mole ratio of chlorine and sodium chloride is 1:2
    So Amount of sodium chloride =  0.08 Mole
    Mass of sodium chloride = 0.08 * 58.5 = 4.68 g
