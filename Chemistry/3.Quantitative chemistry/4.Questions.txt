Structured and short answer questions

    A student heated some copper carbonate in a boiling tube.
    The reaction shown by the equation below occurred.
    CuCO3(s) → CuO(s) + CO2(g)
    He measured the mass of the contents of the boiling tube before and after the reaction.

    His results are in table 1.

    When mass was measured	Mass of contents of crucible
    Before the reaction	          2.48 g
    After the reaction	          1.60 g

    Mass decreased [1] because one of the products/carbon dioxide was formed as a gas that escaped into the air. [1]

    CuCO3 = 64 + 12 + 48 = 124
    CO2 = 44 

    0.02 mol CuCO3 produces 0.02 mol of CO2

    Sample question 4 - Higher
        Question
        A student wanted to make 10.0 g of zinc chloride.
        The equation for the reaction is:
        ZnO(aq) + 2HCl(aq) → ZnCl2(aq) + H2O(l)
        Calculate the mass of zinc oxide the student needs to react with the dilute acid to make 10.0 g of zinc chloride. [4 marks]        
        Then divide the concentration in g/dm3 by the mass of one mole of solute to find the concentration in mol/dm3. [1]

    Ans
        Mr of zinc chloride = 65 + (2 × 35.5) = 136 [1]
        Amount of zinc chloride in mol = 10.0 g ÷ 136 g/mol = 0.0735294 mol [1]
        Amount of zinc oxide required = 0.0735294 mol
        Mr of zinc oxide = 65 + 16 = 81 [1]
        Mass of zinc oxide = 0.0735294 mol × 81 g/mol = 6.0 g (2 significant figures) [1]

    Sample question 1 - Foundation
    Question
        Calcium nitrate contains calcium ions and nitrate ions.
        Calculate the relative formula mass of calcium nitrate, Ca(NO3)2.
        (relative atomic masses: Ca = 40, N = 14, O = 16) [2 marks]

    Sample question 2 - Foundation
    Question
        Magnesium reacts with oxygen:
        2Mg + O2 → 2MgO
        Calculate the maximum mass of magnesium oxide that can be formed from 4.8 g of magnesium.
        (Relative atomic mass of Mg = 24; relative formula mass of MgO = 40) [2 marks]

        Amount of magnesium = 4.8/24 = 0.2 Mol
        Molar ration between Mg and MgO is 1 : 1 
        So this reaction would create 0.2 Mol of MgO
        Mass of 0.2 Mol of MgO = 40 * 0.2 = 8 gm 

    Sample question 3 - Higher
        Question
        Calculate the mass of 0.25 mol of carbon dioxide, CO2.

    Sample question 4 - Higher
        Question
        50 cm3 of potassium hydroxide solution of concentration 40 g/dm3 is needed for an experiment.
        Calculate the mass of potassium hydroxide that must be dissolved in water to make 50 cm3 of solution of this concentration. [2 marks]

            Volume in dm3 = 50 /1000 = 0.050 dm3
            Mass = concentration × volume
            Mass = 40 g/dm3 × 0.050 dm3 [1]
            = 2 g [1]

    Sample question 1 - Foundation
        A teacher mixed aluminium and iodine powder, and added a drop of water.
        The reaction shown by the equation below occurred.
        2Al(s) + 3I2(s) → 2AlI3(s)
        Explain what is shown by the formulae in the equation, and by the equation itself. [6 marks]
    Answer
        The reactants are aluminium and iodine
        Iodine exists as molecules, each made up of two iodine atoms
        The product is aluminium iodide
        In aluminium iodide there are three atoms of iodine for every one atom of aluminium
        Two atoms of aluminium react with (3 × 2) = 6 atoms of iodine
        There are the same number of atoms of each element before and after the reaction

    Sample question 2 - Foundation
        State the law of conservation of mass, and explain why some reactions may appear to involve a change in mass. [6 marks]
    Answer
        In a chemical reaction no atoms are lost or made.
        The mass of products is equal to the mass of reactants.
        Sometimes the mass appears to increase.
        This is often because a solid reactant has joined to a gas from the air.
        Sometimes the mass appears to decrease.
        This is often because one of the products is a gas which is released to the air.

    Sample question 3 - Higher
        Explain why 1 mol of aluminium sulfate has a number of ions that is five times greater than the number of atoms in 1 mol of aluminium metal.
        Include a chemical formula in your answer.
        The value of the Avogadro constant is 6.02 × 1023/mol. [6 marks]
    Answer
        The formula of aluminium sulfate is Al2(SO4)3.
        There are 2 mol of aluminium ions and 3 mol of sulfate ions/a total of 5 mol of ions in 1 mol of aluminium sulfate.
        There is 1 mol of aluminium atoms in 1 mol of aluminium metal.
        The Avogadro constant is the number of particles in one mole of a substance.
        1 mol of aluminium sulfate has 5 mol × 6.02 × 1023/mol = 3.01 × 1024 ions.
        1 mol of aluminium metal has 1 mol × 6.02 × 1023/mol = 6.02 × 1023 atoms.

            spatula
            watch glass
    Answer
        Place the watch glass on the balance.
        Use the spatula to place some calcium carbonate on the watch glass and record the mass of calcium carbonate.
        Place a beaker of hydrochloric acid on the balance. Record the mass of acid + beaker.
        Calculate the total mass of reactants + beaker.
        Add the calcium carbonate to the acid in the beaker on the balance.
        Record the mass when the effervescence finishes.
