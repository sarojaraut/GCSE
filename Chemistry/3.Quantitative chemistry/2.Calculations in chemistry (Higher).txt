Calculations in chemistry (Higher)
	The actual masses of atoms, molecules and ions are too small to be useful in calculations. For this reason, chemical amounts are measured in moles. The mole is a unit. Its symbol is mol.

	The mass of one mole of a substance is equal to:

		the relative atomic mass (Ar) of its formula in grams if the substance is an element
		the relative formula mass (Mr) of its formula in grams if the substance is a compound

		Mass of 1 mol of Ca = 40g
		Mass of 1 mol of O2 = 32g

	Avogadro constant
		One mole of a substance contains the same number of particles as one mole of any other substance. The particles can be atoms, molecules or ions.

		The number of atoms, molecules or ions in one mole of a substance is called the Avogadro constant. Its value is 6.02 × 1023 per mole,

Moles and masses - Higher

	The mass of a substance can be calculated from the number of moles, and the number of moles of a substance can be calculated from its mass. The link between the two quantities is the relative formula mass.

	Mass = relative formula mass × amount

	Calculate the mass of 0.25 mol of carbon dioxide molecules. (Mr of CO2 = 44)
	mass = 0.25 * 44 = 11 g

	Calculate the amount of carbon atoms in 6.0 g of carbon. (Ar of C = 12)
	amount = mass / relative atomic mass 
	amount = 12/6 = 2 mole

Mole calculations - Higher
	A balanced equation shows the amounts in moles of reactants that react and the amounts of products that are made. From these amounts, the masses of reactants and products can be calculated.

	Amounts from equations
	In a balanced equation, the coefficients (the numbers in front of the formulae) show the amounts of the reactants and products. If there is no coefficient, the amount is one mole.

	For example, the equation below shows that one mole of zinc reacts with two moles of hydrochloric acid to make one mole of zinc chloride and one mole of hydrogen molecules.
		Zn(s) + 2HCl(aq) → ZnCl2(aq)+ H2(g)

	Example : 2Mg(s) + O2(g) → 2MgO(s)
	The equation shows that 2 mol of magnesium metal reacts with 1 mol of oxygen molecules.

	The masses of substances shown in a balanced equation can be calculated using the equation: mass = relative formula mass × amount
		Magnesium, Mg	24 × 2 = 48 g
		Oxygen, O2	2 × 16 = 32 g
		Magnesium oxide, MgO	(24 + 16) × 2 = 80 g

	In the reaction shown by the equation below, what mass of sulfur dioxide can be made from 16 g of sulfur? (Mr of SO2 = 64)
		S(s) + O2(g) → SO2(g)

		Amount = mass / relative atomic mass = 16/32 = 0.5 mol
	The equation shows that 1 mol of sulfur reacts with 1 mol of oxygen molecules to make 1 mol of sulfur dioxide. This means that 0.5 mol of sulfur makes 0.5 mol of sulfur dioxide.

	mass of SO2 = relative formula mass × amount
	= 64 × 0.5
	= 32 g

	In the reaction shown by the equation below, what mass of nitrogen, N2, is needed to make 120 g of nitrogen monoxide, NO? (Mr of NO = 30 and Mr of N2 = 28) N2(g) + O2(g) → 2NO(g)

	Amount of NO = 120/30 = 4 Mol
	1 Mol of N2 makes 2 Mol of NO
	So to make 4 Mol of NO we need 2 Mol of N2
	Mass of 2 Mol of N2 = 2*28=56g

	Limiting reactants
	A reaction finishes when one of the reactants is all used up. The other reactant has nothing left to react with, so some of it is left over:

		the reactant that is all used up is called the limiting reactant
		the reactant that is left over is described as being in excess
	Reacting mass calculations
		The maximum mass of product formed in a reaction can be calculated using:
			the balanced equation
			the mass of the limiting reactant, and 
			the Ar (relative atomic mass) or Mr (relative formula mass) values of the limiting reactant and the product
Calculating concentrations

	The concentration of a solution can be shown in g/dm3 or mol/dm3. It is often more useful to know the concentration of a reactant in mol/dm3 so that the amount of reactant in a given volume can be calculated.

	Example
	0.5 mol of sodium hydroxide is dissolved in 2 dm3 of water. Calculate the concentration of the sodium hydroxide solution formed.
	concentration = maount of solute in mol / volume in dm3
		= 0.5/2 = 0.25 mol/dm3
		volume must be in dm3 not cm3, 1 cm3 = 1000 dm3

	to convert from mol/dm3 to g/dm3, multiply by the relative formula mass
	to convert from g/dm3 to mol/dm3, divide by the relative formula mass

Volumes of solutions in reactions

	The amount in moles of a solute in a given volume of solution can be calculated if the concentration of the solution is known. The mass of solute can then be calculated.

	Example
		Calculate the amount of sodium hydroxide, NaOH, in 25.0 cm3 of solution of concentration 0.1 mol/dm3.

		0.1 = x / 0.025 dm3 
		=> x = 0.0025 mol
