### Three and Four Mark Questions

1. **Explain how increasing the concentration of reactants affects the rate of reaction.** (3 marks)
   **Answer:** Increasing concentration means more particles per unit volume. This increases the frequency of collisions between reactant particles. More collisions mean more successful collisions per second, so the rate increases.

2. **Describe how a catalyst works.** (4 marks)
   **Answer:** A catalyst provides an alternative reaction pathway with lower activation energy. This means more particles have sufficient energy to react. The catalyst is not used up in the reaction. It can be recovered at the end.

3. **Explain what happens to the equilibrium position when pressure is increased in a reaction involving gases.** (3 marks)
   **Answer:** According to Le Chatelier's principle, the system opposes the change. If pressure increases, equilibrium shifts to the side with fewer gas molecules to reduce pressure.

4. **Describe the difference between exothermic and endothermic reactions.** (4 marks)
   **Answer:** In exothermic reactions, energy is released to the surroundings, so temperature increases. The products have less energy than reactants. In endothermic reactions, energy is taken from surroundings, so temperature decreases. Products have more energy than reactants.

5. **Explain why reactions are faster at higher temperatures.** (3 marks)
   **Answer:** At higher temperatures, particles have more kinetic energy. More particles have energy equal to or greater than activation energy. Frequency of successful collisions increases.

6. **Describe how to measure the rate of reaction using a gas syringe.** (4 marks)
   **Answer:** Set up apparatus with gas syringe connected to reaction flask. Start reaction and record volume of gas produced at regular time intervals. Plot a graph of volume against time. Rate is the gradient of the graph.

7. **Explain the effect of surface area on reaction rate.** (3 marks)
   **Answer:** Increasing surface area exposes more particles to collision. More reactant particles are available for collision. Frequency of successful collisions increases, so rate increases.

8. **Describe neutralisation and give an example.** (4 marks)
   **Answer:** Neutralisation is reaction between acid and base to form salt and water. Example: HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H₂O. The H⁺ ions from acid react with OH⁻ ions from base.

### Maths Questions

1. **The graph shows how the volume of gas produced changes with time for the reaction between magnesium and hydrochloric acid. Calculate the average rate of reaction between 0 and 20 seconds.** (3 marks)

   (Graph would show: Time (s): 0, 20, 40, 60
   Volume (cm³): 0, 30, 45, 50)

   **Answer:** Rate = change in volume / change in time = 30 cm³ / 20 s = 1.5 cm³/s

2. **In a reaction, 2.4 g of magnesium reacts with excess acid to produce 2.4 dm³ of hydrogen gas at RTP. Calculate the rate if this takes 30 seconds.** (3 marks)
   **Answer:** Rate = volume of gas produced / time = 2.4 dm³ / 30 s = 0.08 dm³/s

3. **The rate of reaction is 0.5 mol/dm³/s. If 2 moles of reactant produce 1 mole of gas, calculate the volume of gas produced per second at RTP.** (3 marks)
   **Answer:** Moles of gas per second = 0.5 mol/dm³/s × 1 mol gas / 2 mol reactant = 0.25 mol/s
   Volume = 0.25 mol × 24 dm³/mol = 6 dm³/s

4. **Calculate the percentage yield if 12 g of product is obtained from a reaction that should produce 15 g.** (2 marks)
   **Answer:** Percentage yield = (actual yield / theoretical yield) × 100 = (12/15) × 100 = 80%

5. **In electrolysis, 0.5 moles of electrons produce 12 g of magnesium. Calculate the time taken if current is 2 A.** (4 marks)
   **Answer:** Charge = moles × Faraday constant = 0.5 × 96500 = 48250 C
   Time = charge / current = 48250 / 2 = 24125 seconds

6. **The equilibrium constant Kc for a reaction is 4. If [A] = 2 mol/dm³ and [B] = 1 mol/dm³, calculate [C].** (3 marks)
   **Answer:** For A + B ⇌ C, Kc = [C]/[A][B] = 4
   4 = [C]/(2×1) = [C]/2
   [C] = 8 mol/dm³

### Six Mark Questions

1. **Describe an experiment to investigate how temperature affects the rate of reaction between sodium thiosulfate and hydrochloric acid. Include how you would measure the rate and ensure it is a fair test.** (6 marks)
   **Answer:** Place a conical flask with sodium thiosulfate solution on a cross marked on paper. Add hydrochloric acid and start stopwatch. Observe the cross disappearing through the solution. Record time for cross to disappear. Repeat at different temperatures (e.g. 20°C, 30°C, 40°C, 50°C). Use water bath to control temperature. Keep volumes and concentrations constant. Plot graph of 1/time against temperature. Rate increases with temperature as shown by shorter times.

2. **Explain the factors affecting the rate of reaction, using collision theory.** (6 marks)
   **Answer:** Collision theory states particles must collide with sufficient energy and correct orientation. Temperature increases kinetic energy, more particles exceed activation energy. Concentration increases particle density, more collisions. Surface area exposes more particles. Pressure (gases) increases collisions. Catalysts lower activation energy, more successful collisions without being used up.

3. **Describe the electrolysis of sodium chloride solution, including the products at each electrode and the reasons for these products.** (6 marks)
   **Answer:** Sodium chloride solution contains Na⁺, Cl⁻, H⁺, OH⁻ ions. At cathode (negative), H⁺ ions are preferentially discharged to form hydrogen gas. At anode (positive), Cl⁻ ions are discharged to form chlorine gas. This is because H⁺ ions are more easily reduced than Na⁺, and Cl⁻ are more easily oxidised than OH⁻. The solution becomes alkaline at cathode due to OH⁻ accumulation, and acidic at anode due to H⁺ accumulation.

4. **Explain reversible reactions and equilibrium, including how changing conditions affects the position of equilibrium.** (6 marks)
   **Answer:** Reversible reactions can proceed in both directions, shown by ⇌. Equilibrium is reached when forward and backward rates equal. Position can shift according to Le Chatelier's principle. Increasing temperature shifts exothermic reactions left, endothermic right. Increasing pressure shifts to side with fewer gas molecules. Increasing concentration of reactant shifts equilibrium to product side. Catalysts speed up both rates equally, no effect on position.

5. **Describe how to carry out a titration to find the concentration of a hydrochloric acid solution.** (6 marks)
   **Answer:** Use pipette to measure 25 cm³ of acid into conical flask. Add indicator (phenolphthalein). Fill burette with standard alkali (e.g. 0.1 mol/dm³ NaOH). Add alkali slowly while swirling until indicator changes colour. Record volume added. Repeat to get concordant results. Calculate concentration using formula: concentration acid × volume acid = concentration alkali × volume alkali. Average titres, calculate unknown concentration.

6. **Explain the difference between strong and weak acids and alkalis, including their ionisation and effect on pH.** (6 marks)
   **Answer:** Strong acids completely ionise in water, producing many H⁺ ions, low pH (0-3). Weak acids partially ionise, fewer H⁺ ions, higher pH (4-6). Strong alkalis completely ionise producing many OH⁻ ions, high pH (11-14). Weak alkalis partially ionise, fewer OH⁻ ions, lower pH (8-10). Conductivity: strong electrolytes conduct well, weak poorly. Reaction rates: strong acids react faster. pH curves: strong acids show steep vertical line, weak show gradual curve.
