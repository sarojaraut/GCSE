1.Groups in the periodic table - AQA

Group 0 - physical properties

Group 0 contains non-metal elements placed in the vertical column on the far right of the periodic table. The elements in group 0 are called the noble gases. They exist as single atoms.

He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, Rn, Og

The noble gases all have low boiling points:
helium, at the top of group 0, has the lowest boiling point of any element
the attractive forces between the atoms become stronger.
This is because, going down group 0: the atoms become larger
the intermolecular forces between the atoms become stronger more energy is needed to overcome these forces

Group 0 - chemical properties
Compared to other elements, the noble gases are inert - they are extremely unreactive and do not take part in chemical reactions.

All the noble gases have complete outer shells:
This means that they have no tendency to lose, gain, or share electrons.

Group 1 - physical properties

li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Fr

The elements in group 1 are called the alkali metals

The alkali metals share similar physical properties. For example, they:
are soft (they can be cut with a knife)
have relatively low melting points
have low densities
