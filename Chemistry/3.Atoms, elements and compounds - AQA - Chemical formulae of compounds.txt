3.Atoms, elements and compounds - AQA - Chemical formulae of compounds
A compound is a substance that contains two or more elements that are chemically combined. The elements in a compound are present in fixed proportions.

Sodium chloride	    NaCl
Potassium bromide	KBr
Magnesium iodide	MgI2
Carbon dioxide	    CO2
Carbon monoxide	    CO
Sulfur trioxide	    SO3
Water	            H2O
Ammonia	            NH3
Methane	            CH4
HydrogenSulfide     H2S : Poison gas in fart

In compounds made up of non-metal elements only, the second word of the compound's name starts with mon-, di-, or tri-, eg carbon dioxide. This shows the number of atoms of this element for every one atom of the first element in the name.
