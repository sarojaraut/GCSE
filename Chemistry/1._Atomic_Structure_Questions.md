## Three and Four Mark Questions

1. Explain why atoms are neutral. (2 marks)
   - **Answer:** Atoms are neutral because they have an equal number of protons (positive charge) and electrons (negative charge).

2. Describe the structure of an atom. (3 marks)
   - **Answer:** An atom has a small, dense nucleus containing protons and neutrons. Electrons orbit the nucleus in shells/energy levels.

3. Explain why elements in the same group of the periodic table have similar chemical properties. (3 marks)
   - **Answer:** Elements in the same group have the same number of electrons in their outer shell, which determines their chemical reactivity and properties.

4. Describe how the periodic table is arranged. (3 marks)
   - **Answer:** The periodic table is arranged in order of increasing atomic number. Elements with similar properties are placed in the same group (vertical columns).

5. Explain the difference between atomic number and mass number. (2 marks)
   - **Answer:** Atomic number is the number of protons. Mass number is the total number of protons and neutrons.

6. Describe the properties of Group 1 elements (alkali metals). (3 marks)
   - **Answer:** Alkali metals are soft, reactive metals that react vigorously with water to produce hydrogen gas and an alkaline solution.

7. Explain why Group 7 elements (halogens) are reactive. (3 marks)
   - **Answer:** Halogens have 7 electrons in their outer shell and need one more electron to complete the shell, making them reactive as they tend to gain electrons.

8. Describe the properties of Group 0 elements (noble gases). (2 marks)
   - **Answer:** Noble gases are unreactive, colorless gases that exist as single atoms.

9. Explain what isotopes are. (3 marks)
   - **Answer:** Isotopes are atoms of the same element with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons, so they have the same atomic number but different mass numbers.

10. Describe the transition metals. (3 marks)
    - **Answer:** Transition metals are elements in the central block of the periodic table. They are hard, strong, good conductors of heat and electricity, and form colored compounds.

## Six Mark Questions

1. Describe the structure of an atom and explain how this relates to the arrangement of elements in the periodic table. (6 marks)
   - **Answer:** 
     - Atoms consist of a nucleus containing protons (positively charged) and neutrons (neutral), with electrons (negatively charged) orbiting in shells around the nucleus.
     - The atomic number is determined by the number of protons.
     - Elements are arranged in the periodic table by increasing atomic number.
     - Elements in the same group have the same number of electrons in their outer shell, leading to similar chemical properties.
     - The number of electron shells increases down a group, and the number of outer electrons determines group number.

2. Explain the differences between atoms, elements, compounds and mixtures, giving examples. (6 marks)
   - **Answer:**
     - An atom is the smallest particle of an element that retains its properties (e.g., a carbon atom).
     - An element is a substance made of only one type of atom (e.g., carbon or oxygen).
     - A compound is formed when two or more elements are chemically combined in fixed proportions (e.g., water H2O or carbon dioxide CO2).
     - A mixture is a physical combination of substances that can be separated by physical means (e.g., air or salt water).
     - Compounds have different properties from their constituent elements, while mixtures retain the properties of their components.
     - Compounds are represented by chemical formulas, mixtures by percentages or descriptions.

3. Describe the properties of the main groups in the periodic table and explain how these properties change across a period. (6 marks)
   - **Answer:**
     - Group 1 (alkali metals): Soft, reactive metals that react with water to form alkalis and hydrogen.
     - Group 7 (halogens): Reactive non-metals that form salts with metals.
     - Group 0 (noble gases): Unreactive gases.
     - Across a period (left to right), atomic number increases, number of outer electrons increases from 1 to 8.
     - Metals are on the left, non-metals on the right.
     - Reactivity generally decreases across a period for metals, increases for non-metals.
     - Elements become less metallic and more non-metallic across a period.
