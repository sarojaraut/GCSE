    What are the chemical formulae of the elements neon, nitrogen and sodium? Ne, N2, Na

    Predict which becomes white more quickly on exposure to air - a piece of rubidium, or a piece of lithium. Explain your answer.
    The rubidium becomes white more quickly. This is because rubidium is below lithium in group 1, so rubidium is more reactive.
    The reactivity of the group 1 elements increases down the group, so their reactions with oxygen get more vigorous.

    Compare the properties of sodium and chromium. How does the data show that chromium is a typical transition element, and sodium is a typical group 1 metal?
        Chromium has a much higher melting point than sodium. The density of chromium is also greater than sodium.
    Predict the differences in the hardness and strength of nickel and potassium. Give a reason for your prediction.
        Nickel is harder and stronger than potassium. The reason for this prediction is that nickel is a transition element and potassium is in group 1.

Multiple choice questions

    Which two substances are mixtures? Air and Steel
    The electronic structures of the atoms of five elements are shown below:
    Which element is a metal in the same group of the periodic table as element A? Same number of electron in outer shell

    The table below shows the boiling points of some elements in group 7 of the periodic table. 
    Why does iodine have a higher boiling point than chlorine? 
    Ans : The forces between iodine molecules are stronger. 
    Covalent bond between iodine atoms stronger also looks like an potential solution but covalent bond is also true for Cl and Br

    Chlorine displaces bromine from bromide ions.
    Cl2 + 2Br- → 2Cl- + Br2 
    Ans : Bromide ions lose electrons and are oxidised
    When negative ions lose electrons, they are undergoing oxidation.
