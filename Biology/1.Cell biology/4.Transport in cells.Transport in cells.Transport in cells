4.Transport in cells

    Diffusion
    Particles (molecules and ions) in a liquid and a gas move continuously. Because of this movement, particles will spread themselves evenly throughout a liquid or a gas
    Fart(H2S) hydrogen sulphide spreads in gas

    If there is a situation where particles of a substance are in a higher concentration, they will move from this region to where they are in a lower concentration. THis is called Diffusion

    It is important to remember that the particles: will move in both directions, but there will be a net movement from high to low concentration

    Some examples of diffusion in biological systems
    LIver cells has high concentration of urea (Nh2)2CO, that diffuses to bloodstream(which has low concentration of urea), where it travels to the kidneys and is ultimately excreted in urine. 

    Blood from the body has high in co2 and low in o2 -> co2 diffuses from high concentration blood to low concentration alveolus then breath out
    O2 diffuses from High concentration in alveolus to low concentration in blood


    Mixing particles
    If a crystal of a coloured chemical, eg potassium manganate (VII) (Solute), is placed in water (Solvent), the particles spread out and mix with the water particles. The mixture is the solution

    The rate of diffusion
    The greater the difference in concentration, the quicker the rate of diffusion.
    The higher the temperature, the more kinetic energy the particles will have, so they will move and mix more quickly.
    The greater the surface area, the faster the rate of diffusion.

    The movement of water molecules across a selectively permeable membrane from a region of higher water concentration to a region of lower water concentration.

    Puppies have a larger surface area to volume ratio than adult dogs, so will lose heat more readily.

    Cell models
    Cells can be modelled using cubes. and surface area to volums ration can be plotted using different size of cube
    Bacterium has a surface area ro volume ratio = 6 000 000 : 1
    whale has a surface area ro volume ratio = 0.06 : 1

    Large organisms:
        have mechanisms to increase surface area proportionately, such as additional absorbing areas or adaptations of shape
        have transport systems and keep distances to a minumum for diffusion

    Osmosis
        Osmosis is the diffusion of water molecules, from a region where the water molecules are in higher concentration, to a region where they are inlower concentration, through a partially permeable membrane.

        A dilute solution contains a high concentration of water molecules, while a concentrated solution contains a low concentration of water molecules.

        The beaker contains water and sugar molecules, beaker-1 has low sugar and high water and beaker-2 has high sugar and low water. Water molecules pass through/diffuses from solution one to two

        Osmosis across living cells
            Cells contain dilute solutions of ions, sugars andamino acids.
            The cell membrane is partially permeable.
            Water will move into and out of cells by osmosis.

        In animals, the concentration of body fluids – blood plasma and tissue fluid – must be kept within strict limits – if cells lose or gain too much water by osmosis, they do not function efficiently.

        How to investigate osmosis
            Experiment is putting patato cylinders in sucrose(table sugar) solutions for 40 minutes and noticing the percentage change in their mass.
            Independent Variable: The concentration of the sucrose solutions, with a range of 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0 mol/dm-3.
            Dependent variable: The change in mass of the potato cylinders.
            Control variables: The time that each cylinder is left in the sucrose solution, the size of each cylinder.

            Solution concentration is measured in mol/dm-3
            mole is molecular mass : The amount of substance that contains the same number of particles as there are atoms in 12 g of carbon-12 (contains the Avogadro's constant 6.022 ×10²³ number of particles). 
            dm-3 : decimal cube is equals to 1 liter 1000 cubic centimeter
            A 1.0 mol dm-3 solution of a substance contains one mole of the substance per dm-3 of a solution, or one mole per litre of solution. MOlar mass of sucrose ( C12H12O11) is 342.3 g/mol

            Patato cylinder in the distiled water : water will diffuse into patato causing slight increase in mass
            Patato cylinder in the 0.2 mol dm-3 sol : water will diffuse into patato causing lesser increase in mass than distlled water
            For all other solution mass will decrease with max decrease in 1 mol dm-3. Water came out of patato into water
            if you plot a graph then where the graph crosses x asis is the concentration of sucrose in patato : around 2.7. 
            This means if you are eating 1 kg of patato then eating 270 gm of sugar

            Glycemic Index (GI) (range of 1 to 100) of a food says how fast a food can be converted into sugar and cause blood sugar spike
            High GI foods are like patato rice, white wheat flour above 70. Instant cereals, sodas, sports drinks, cakes, doughnuts, pancackes, watermelon, chips, crisps, Eating them in moderation is key to control blood sugar spike.
            Att(whole wheat flour) is around 40-60 is better option

        Active transport
            Substances are transported passively down concentration gradients. Often, substances have to be moved from a low to a high concentration - against  concentration gradient.

            Active transport is a process that is required to move molecules against a concentration gradient.The process requires energy.
            
            Active transport in plants
            Active transport occurs across the root so that the plant takes in the ions it needs from the soil around it. Root has high concentration and soil has low concentration.

            Active transport in animals
                In animals, glucose molecules have to be moved across the gut wall into the blood. The glucose molecules in the intestine might be in a higher concentration than in the intestinal cells and blood – for instance, after a sugary meal

                All the glucose in the gut needs to be absorbed. When the glucose concentration in the intestine is lower than in the intestinal cells, movement of glucose involves active transport.

        Comparing diffusion, osmosis and active transport
            Diffusion	Substances move from a high to a low concentration down a concentration gradient
            Osmosis	Water moves from a high to a low concentration across a partially permeable membrane and down a concentration gradient
            Active transport	Substances move against a concentration gradient
