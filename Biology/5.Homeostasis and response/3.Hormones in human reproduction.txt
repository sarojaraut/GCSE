3.Hormones in human reproduction

    The role of reproductive hormones in the menstrual cycle
        A hormone is a chemical substance, produced by a gland and carried by the blood, which alters the activity of specific target organs (and is then destroyed by the liver).
        Different hormones affect different organs or cells.

    Puberty
        Puberty is the stage in life when a child's body develops into an adult's body. The changes take place gradually, usually between the ages of 10 and 16.

        During puberty, reproductive hormones cause secondary sex characteristics to develop:

        testosterone - produced by the testes – is the main male reproductive hormone and it stimulates sperm production
        oestrogen - produced by the ovaries – is the main female reproductive hormone. At puberty, eggs begin to mature and one is released approximately every 28 days. This is ovulation.

        The menstrual cycle is a recurring process which takes around 28 days. During the process, the lining of the uterus(womb) is prepared for pregnancy. If implantation of the fertilised egg into the uterus lining does not happen, the lining is then shed. This is known as menstruation.

        Several hormones control this cycle – for example, they are involved in controlling the release of an egg each month from an ovary, and changing the thickness of the uterus lining.
