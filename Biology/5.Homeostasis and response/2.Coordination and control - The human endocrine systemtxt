2.Coordination and control - The human endocrine system

Hormones and nerves
    A hormone is a chemical substance, produced by a gland and carried in the bloodstream, which alters the activity of specific target organs. An example of this is the release of the hormone adrenaline, which is released by the adrenal gland. One of its target organs is the heart, where it increases the heart rate.

    Once a hormone has been used, it is destroyed by the liver.
    Hormones can control the body, and the effects are much slower than the nervous system, but they last for longer.

    Contraceptive pills contain hormones to reduce the chances of becoming pregnant

    There are important differences between nervous and hormonal control.

    Master gland
        The pituitary gland in the brain is known as a 'master gland'. It secretes several hormones into the blood in response to the body's condition, such as blood water levels. These hormones can also act on other glands to stimulate the release of different types of hormones and bring about effects.

    Different hormones
        The body produces a range of different chemical hormones that travel in the bloodstream and affect a number of different organs or cells in the body. The diagram below shows this in detail.

        Important hormones released into the bloodstream include ADH (anti-diuretic hormone), adrenaline and insulin.

        	        Source	          Organ(s)	         Role	                                                                           Effects
        ADH	        Pituitary gland	  Kidneys	         Controlling the water content of the blood	                                       Increases reabsorption of water by the collecting ducts
        Adrenaline	Adrenal glands	  Several targets including the respiratory and circulatory systems	Preparation for 'fight or flight'	Increases breathing rate, heart rate, flow of blood to muscles, conversion of glycogen to glucose
        Insulin	    Pancreas	       Liver	        Controlling blood glucose levels	                                                Increases conversion of glucose into glycogen for storage

A negative feedback mechanism is an important type of control that is found in homeostasis. A negative feedback control system responds when conditions change from the ideal or set point and returns conditions to this set point. There is a continuous cycle of events in negative feedback.

    General stages in negative feedback
    In general this works by:

    if the level of something rises, control systems reduce it again
    if the level of something falls, control systems raise it again

    An example of negative feedback is the control of body temperature. Body temperature is controlled by the hypothalamus in your brain, and if your body gets too hot, your body begins to sweat to try and reduce it. Conversely if the body gets too cold, it begins to shiver to try and raise the temperature.

Thyroxine and adrenaline 

    Thyroxine is produced from the thyroid gland, which stimulates the basal metabolic rate. It controls the speed at which oxygen and food products react to release energy for the body to use. Thyroxine plays an important role in growth and development. 

    The hypothalamus and pituitary gland have important roles in detecting and controlling thyroxine levels.

    Low thyroxine levels in the bloodstream stimulate the hypothalamus to release TRH(Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone) and this causes the pituitary to release TSH(Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone) so the thyroid releases more thyroxine. So blood levels return to normal.
    Normal thyroxine levels in the bloodstream inhibit TRH release from the hypothalamus and this inhibits the release of TSH from the pituitary, so normal blood levels are maintained.

    Adrenaline is produced by the adrenal glands in times of fear or stress. It targets vital organs, increases the heart rate and boosts the delivery of oxygen and glucose to the brain and muscles, preparing the body for 'flight or fight'. Adrenaline is not controlled by negative feedback.

    When adrenaline is released into the bloodstream it creates multiple effects:

    increases breathing rate, heart rate, and conversion of glycogen to glucose so more energy is released in the muscles
    it diverts blood away from areas, such as the digestive system, towards the muscles
    The effects of adrenaline allow the body to prepare for action in situations where a quick response may be essential.

Control of blood glucose concentration by pancreas and insulin
    Glucose is needed by cells for respiration. It is important that the concentration of glucose in the blood is maintained at a constant level and controlled carefully. Insulin is a hormone - produced by the pancreas - that regulates glucose concentrations in the blood.

    If the blood glucose concentration is too high, the pancreas produces the hormone insulin that causes glucose to move from the blood into the cells. In liver and muscle cells excess glucose is converted to glycogen for storage, and will be used at a later date.

    Action of insulin
                                        Low glucose	                                High glucose
        Effect on pancreas	            Insulin not secreted into the blood	        Insulin secreted into the blood
        Effect on liver	                Does not convert glucose into glycogen	    Converts glucose into glycogen
        Effect on blood glucose level	Increases	                                Decreases

Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes
    Diabetes is a condition where the blood glucose levels remain too high. It can be treated by injecting insulin. The extra insulin causes the liver to convert glucose into glycogen, which reduces the blood glucose level.

    Type 1 diabetes
        Type 1 diabetes is a disorder in which the pancreas fails to produce enough insulin. This can be detected from an early age. It is characterised by uncontrolled high blood glucose levels and it can be controlled by injecting insulin.

        They can help to control their blood glucose level by being careful with their diet, and eat foods that will not cause large increases in blood sugar level, and by exercising, which can lower blood glucose levels due to increased respiration in the muscles.

    Type 2 diabetes
        In type 2 diabetes the person's body cells no longer respond to insulin produced by the pancreas. It is more common in older people. It can be controlled by a carbohydrate controlled diet and an exercise regime. Carbohydrate is digested into glucose, which raises the overall blood glucose level. There is a correlation between rising levels of obesity in the general population and increasing levels of type 2 diabetes.

Role of glucagon in control of blood sugar levels

    Negative feedback
        In blood glucose regulation, the hormone insulin plays a key role. When blood sugar rises in the blood, insulin sends a signal to the liver, muscles and other cells to store the excess glucose. Some is stored as body fat and other is stored as glycogen in the liver and muscles. Whereas, if the blood glucose level is too low, the liver receives a message to release some of that stored glucose into the blood. This change is brought about by another hormone produced by the pancreas called glucagon.

    The role of reproductive hormones in puberty

    Puberty

        Puberty is the stage in life when a child's body develops into an adult's body. The changes take place gradually, usually between the ages of 10 and 16.Changes occur at puberty because of hormones:

            testosterone - produced by the testes - controls the development of male secondary sexual characteristics
            oestrogen - produced by the ovaries - controls the development of female secondary sexual characteristics

       Hair grows on face and body	        Underarm hair grows	                       Hips get wider
