Algebraic formulae
    The plural of formula is formulae.
    A formula is a mathematical rule or relationship that uses letters to represent amounts which can be changed – these are called variables.

    Function notation

Factorising is the reverse process of expanding brackets.

In Foundation Tier, 𝑎 will always be 1, so quadratic expressions will be in the form 𝑥² + 𝑏𝑥 + 𝑐.

To factorise the quadratic 𝑥² + 𝑏𝑥 + 𝑐, the sum of the two numbers in the brackets must be 𝑏, and the product must be 𝑐.

𝑥² + 12𝑥 + 20

Factorising quadratic expressions of the form 𝑎𝑥² + 𝑏𝑥 + 𝑐 where 𝑎 is greater than 1 requires a different method to those where 𝑎 = 1.

Multiply the coefficient of 𝑥2 and the constant term

Key points about algebraic reasoning and proof

    Two even numbers added together will always make an even number because they are always in groups of 2.
    Two odd numbers added together will always make an even number because the extra ​1s​​​​​ add together to make another lot of 2.
    An even and an odd number added together make an odd number because there will always be an extra 1.
    An e​​ven lot of an odd number becomes even because the extra 1s are paired together. An odd​​ lot of an odd number is odd because there will always be an extra 1 left.​

New geometric and special sequences

Graphs of quadratic functions

Graph of y = ax2 + bx + c

if a> 0 then parabola opening upwards, with turning point at the bottom
if a < 0 then parabola opening downwards, with turning point at the top

The roots or solutions to the equation are the values of the x-coordinates of the points where the graph crosses the
-axis.

if the quadratic equation has no roots then that means that curve does not intersect x-axis
y intercet can be found by putting x=0

so the actual slope of tangent is 3/4: find y intercept and find out equation of line

Transformation of curves
The graph of y=f(x) where  f(x)=x**2 is the same as the graph of y=x**2. Writing equations as functions in the form
f(x) is useful when applying translations and reflections to graphs.

Translations parallel to the y-axis
If f(x) = x**2 , then f(x) = a+ x**2. Here we are adding a to the whole function. The addition of the value
 represents a vertical translation in the graph. If a is positive, the graph translates upwards. If a
 is negative, the graph translates downwards.

Translations parallel to the x-axis
If f(x) = x**2 , then f(x+a) = (x+a)**2.

Here we add a to x, not to the whole function. This time we will get a horizontal translation. If a is positive then the graph will translate to the left. If the value of a is negative, then the graph will translate to the right.

f(x) = x**2, y=f(x), y = f(x-2), graph will be translated to right

if f(x+a) represents a transalation of graph f(x) then in vector form it this translation is represented as (-a 0)

Reflections of graphs

Graphs can be reflected in either the x or y axes.
Reflections in the x-axis
If f(x) = x**2, then -f(x) = -(x**2)
Reflections in the y-axis
If f(x) = x**3, then f(-x) = (-x**3)
