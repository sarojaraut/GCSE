Whole numbers
    7 Ã— 8 = x then 700 and 80 = ?
    8+4 = x then 0.8 + 0.4 = ?
    26 * 71 = 1846 then 1846 / 7.1 = ?
    8.109 * 100 = ?

    Multiplying and dividing fractions
Standard form
    Standard form is written in the form of a * 10 ** n, where is a number bigger than or equal to 1 and less than 10.
    10 ** -6 = 0.000001 (hou many zeros after decimal point)
Surds
    Roots that cannot be written as exact decimals are called surds. Leaving an answer in surd form means the answer is exact.

Financial mathematics
    gross pay :  before any deductions
    Deductions are income tax, national insurance and sometimes pension contributions
    Net pay is what's left after deductions

    5000 with 3.5% comound interst for three years total = 5000 * 1.035 ** 3 = 5543.59
    5000 with 4% first year, 3.5% second year and 3% third yeartotal = 5000 * 1.04 * 1.035 * 1.03 = 5543.46
VAT
    Value added tax (VAT) is payable to the government by a business.
    Currently it stands at 20% having been increased from 17.5%
    if cost of car is 19800 after 20% vat then price before vat is =
    120% is = 19800
    10% = 19800/12
    10* is = (19800/12)*10
