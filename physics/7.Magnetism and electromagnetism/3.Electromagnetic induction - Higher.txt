Electromagnetic induction - Higher

    Induced potential and the generator effect
        A potential difference or voltage is needed to make an electric current flow in a circuit.
            a coil of wire is moved in a magnetic field
            a magnet is moved into a coil of wire

            This is called electromagnetic induction and is often referred to as the generator effect.
