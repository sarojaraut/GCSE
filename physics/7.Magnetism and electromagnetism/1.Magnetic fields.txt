Magnetic fields

    Poles of a magnet
        A magnet can exert a force on another nearby magnet. Magnets have two poles: north and south pole
        The magnetic force is strongest near the magnet's poles.
        like poles (N-N or S-S) repel
        unlike poles (N-S or S-N) attract
        Magnetic forces are non-contact forces - this means that magnets affect each other without touching.
    Induced and permanent magnetism
        Iron, steel, nickel and cobalt are magnetic materials. They are affected by magnets and are attracted to either pole of a magnet.

    A permanent magnet always causes a force on other magnets, or on magnetic materials. Key features of a permanent magnet:
        it produces its own magnetic field the magnetic field cannot be turned on and off - it is there all the time
        Bar magnets and horseshoe magnets are examples of permanent magnets.
    Induced magnets
        Unlike a permanent magnet, an induced magnet only becomes a magnet when it is placed in a magnetic field. The induced magnetism is quickly lost when the magnet is removed from the magnetic field.

    Detecting and drawing magnetic fields
        A magnetic field is invisible, but it can be detected using a magnetic compass. A compass contains a small bar magnet on a pivot so that it can rotate. The compass needle points in the direction of the Earth's magnetic field, or the magnetic field of a magnet.
    Drawing a magnetic field
        The diagram shows these key features:
        the magnetic field lines never cross each other
        the closer the lines, the stronger the magnetic field
        the lines have arrowheads to show the direction of the force exerted by a magnetic north pole
        the arrowheads point from the north pole of the magnet to its south pole
