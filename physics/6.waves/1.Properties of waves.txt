Properties of waves
Waves are one way in which energy may be transferred between stores.
Both mechanical and electromagnetic waves will transfer energy but not matter.

Waves can be described as oscillations , or vibrations about a rest position.

In longitudinal waves the vibrations are parallel to the direction of wave travel.
In transverse waves the vibrations are at right angles to the direction of wave travel.

Waves are described using the following terms:

rest position - the undisturbed position of particles or fields when they are not vibrating
displacement - the distance that a certain point in the medium has moved from its rest position
peak - the highest point above the rest position
trough - the lowest point below the rest position
amplitude - the maximum displacement of a point of a wave from its rest position
wavelength - distance covered by a full cycle of the wave, usually measured from peak to peak, or trough to trough
time period - the time taken for a full cycle of the wave, usually measured from peak to peak, or trough to trough
frequency - the number of waves passing a point each second

T = 1 / f
the period (T) is measured in seconds (s)
frequency (f) is measured in hertz (Hz)

wave speed = frequency × wavelength
v = f λ
wave speed (v) is measured in metres per second (m/s)
frequency (f) is measured in Hertz (Hz)
wavelength (λ) is measured in metres (m)

v =  / t
speed (v) is measured in metres per second (m/s)
distance (s) is measured in metres (m)
time (t) is measured in seconds (s)
