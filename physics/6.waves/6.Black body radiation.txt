Black body radiation

    Emission and absorption of infrared radiation
        All bodies (objects) emit and absorb infrared radiation. 
            The hotter the body:
                the more infrared radiation it gives out in a given time
                the greater the proportion of emitted radiation is visible light
    Black bodies
        There are no known objects that are perfect at absorbing or emitting all the radiation, of every possible frequency, that may be directed at it. 
        Some objects do, however, come close to this and these are referred to as "black bodies".

    A perfect black body is a theoretical object. It would have these properties:
        it would absorb all the radiation that falls on it
        it would not reflect or transmit any radiation

        An object that is good at absorbing radiation is also a good emitter, so a perfect black body would be the best possible emitter of radiation.

        Stars are considered to be black bodies because they are very good emitters of most wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum.
