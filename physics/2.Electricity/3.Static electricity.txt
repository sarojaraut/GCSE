Static electricity

    Electrical charges
        All matter consists of atoms. Atoms contain three types of smaller particles: protons, neutrons and electrons.
        Of these three, both the protons and electrons are charged.

        Objects that are charged can affect other charged objects using the non-contact forces of static electricity.

    Charging by friction
        When insulating materials rub against each other, they may become electrically charged. 
        Electrons, which are negatively charged, may be ‘rubbed off’ one material and on to the other. 
        The material that gains electrons becomes negatively charged. The material thatloses electrons is left with a positive charge.
