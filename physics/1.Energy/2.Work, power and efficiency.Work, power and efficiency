2.Work, power and efficiency

    Work, power and efficiency : w=fd ( joule = newton*meter)
    Energy and power : p=w/t (watt = joule/second)
    Efficiency : efficiency = useful energy transferred/total energy transferred

    ## Energy and work
        When a force causes a body to move, work is being done on the object by the force. Work is the measure of energy transfer when a force (F) moves an object through a distance (d).
        energy transferred = work done
        work done = force Ã— distance
        W = F * d
        work done (W) is measured in joules (J)
        force (F) is measured in newtons (N)
        distance (d) is in the same direction as the force and is measured in metres (m)

    ## Energy and power
        When work is done on an object, energy is transferred. The rate at which this energy is transferred is called power. So the more powerful a device is, the more energy it will transfer each second.

        P = W/t

        power (P) is measured in watts (W)
        work done (W) is measured in joules (J)
        time (t) is measured in seconds (s)

        One watt is equal to one joule per second (J/s).

    ## Efficiency
        Devices are designed to waste as little energy as possible. This means that as much of the input energy as possible should be transferred into useful energy stores.

        How good a device is at transferring energy input to useful energy output is called efficiency

        efficiency = useful energy transferred/total energy transferred

        What are the useful and wasted stores of energy for a washing machine?
        Useful stores - kinetic energy of the drum, internal (thermal) energy of the water.
        Wasted stores - sound radiation and infrared radiation dissipated to the surroundings.
