## Three and Four Mark Questions

1. **Describe the energy changes when a ball is thrown upwards and falls back to the ground.** (3 marks)  
   **Answer:** When thrown upwards, kinetic energy is transferred to gravitational potential energy. At the top, all energy is gravitational potential. As it falls, gravitational potential energy is transferred back to kinetic energy. Some energy may be dissipated as thermal due to air resistance.

2. **Explain why energy is conserved in a closed system but not in an open system.** (3 marks)  
   **Answer:** In a closed system, no energy enters or leaves, so total energy remains constant. In an open system, energy can enter or leave (e.g., from surroundings), so total energy may change.

## Six Mark Questions

1. **Evaluate the energy transfers in a coal-fired power station. Discuss efficiency and environmental impacts.** (6 marks)  
   **Answer:** In a coal-fired power station, chemical energy in coal is transferred to thermal energy by burning. This heats water to steam, which turns turbines, transferring thermal to kinetic then electrical energy. Efficiency is around 35-40% due to heat losses. Wasted energy is thermal, dissipated to surroundings. Environmental impacts include CO2 emissions contributing to climate change, and particulate pollution. Improvements like combined cycle systems increase efficiency, reducing impacts.

2. **Explain the conservation of energy using the example of a pendulum. Include calculations.** (6 marks)  
   **Answer:** A pendulum demonstrates conservation of energy. At the highest point, energy is gravitational potential (GPE = mgh). As it swings, GPE transfers to kinetic (KE = ½mv²). Total energy = GPE + KE remains constant (ignoring friction). With friction, some KE dissipates as thermal. Calculation: For a 1 kg mass at 2 m height (g=10 m/s²), GPE = 20 J. At bottom, KE = 20 J if no losses. In reality, efficiency <100%.

3. **Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of renewable energy sources like solar panels.** (6 marks)  
   **Answer:** Solar panels convert light energy to electrical. Advantages: Renewable, no fuel costs, low maintenance, reduces CO2 emissions. Disadvantages: Intermittent (only daytime), high initial cost, requires large areas, efficiency around 15-20%. Energy storage like batteries helps intermittency. Overall, benefits outweigh drawbacks for sustainable energy future.

4. **Describe and explain the energy changes in a rollercoaster ride.** (6 marks)  
   **Answer:** At the top, energy is gravitational potential. As it descends, GPE transfers to kinetic, speeding up. At bottom, mostly kinetic. On loops, kinetic transfers back to GPE. Friction dissipates some as thermal. Total energy decreases slightly due to losses. Safety features ensure controlled transfers. This shows conservation but with inefficiencies.

5. **Evaluate the use of insulation in homes to improve energy efficiency.** (6 marks)  
   **Answer:** Insulation reduces thermal energy loss via conduction, convection, radiation. Materials like foam or fiberglass trap air, poor conductor. Benefits: Lower heating bills, reduced carbon footprint, comfortable temperatures. Drawbacks: Initial cost, may require professional installation. Payback period is 5-10 years. Essential for energy conservation in buildings.

6. **Explain how energy is stored and transferred in the human body during exercise.** (6 marks)  
   **Answer:** Food provides chemical energy. During digestion, stored in chemical stores. Exercise transfers chemical to kinetic (movement) and thermal (body heat). Heart pumps, using chemical energy. Efficiency varies; some energy wasted as heat. ATP cycle: Chemical energy in glucose to ATP, used for muscle contraction. Over time, energy conserved but some lost as sweat evaporation.
