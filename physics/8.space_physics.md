## Longer Answer Questions (3-4 marks)

1. Explain why Earth experiences different seasons throughout the year. (4 marks)  
   **Answer:** Earth is tilted on its axis by approximately 23.5 degrees. As Earth orbits the Sun, the tilt means that different parts of the planet receive more direct sunlight at different times of the year. In summer, the hemisphere tilted towards the Sun receives more direct sunlight and longer days. In winter, the same hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun, receiving less direct sunlight and shorter days.

2. Describe the basic structure of our Solar System. (4 marks)  
   **Answer:** The Solar System consists of the Sun at the center, surrounded by eight planets divided into inner and outer planets. The four inner planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars) are rocky and terrestrial. The four outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune) are gas giants. Between Mars and Jupiter lies the asteroid belt, and beyond Neptune is the Kuiper Belt containing icy objects.

3. Explain how artificial satellites remain in orbit around Earth. (3 marks)  
   **Answer:** Satellites remain in orbit due to a balance between gravity pulling them towards Earth and their forward velocity. Gravity provides the centripetal force needed for circular motion, while the satellite's speed prevents it from falling to Earth. If the speed is too low, the satellite falls to Earth; if too high, it escapes Earth's gravity.

4. Describe the life cycle of a massive star (more than 8 times the mass of the Sun). (4 marks)  
   **Answer:** A massive star begins as a main sequence star, fusing hydrogen into helium in its core. When hydrogen is depleted, it becomes a red supergiant, fusing heavier elements. The star then undergoes a supernova explosion, ejecting its outer layers. The core may collapse into a neutron star or, if massive enough, a black hole.

5. Explain what red shift tells us about the Universe and how it provides evidence for the Big Bang theory. (4 marks)  
   **Answer:** Red shift occurs when light from distant galaxies is shifted to longer wavelengths, indicating that galaxies are moving away from us. The further away a galaxy is, the faster it is receding. This observation suggests the Universe is expanding, which supports the Big Bang theory that the Universe began with a rapid expansion from a hot, dense state approximately 13.8 billion years ago.

6. Describe the main points of the Big Bang theory. (3 marks)  
   **Answer:** The Big Bang theory states that the Universe began as an extremely hot, dense point about 13.8 billion years ago. It then expanded rapidly in an event called the Big Bang. As it expanded and cooled, matter formed, eventually leading to the creation of galaxies, stars, and planets. The theory is supported by evidence such as cosmic microwave background radiation and the red shift of galaxies.

7. Explain why geostationary satellites are particularly useful for communication purposes. (3 marks)  
   **Answer:** Geostationary satellites orbit Earth at the same rate as Earth's rotation, remaining above the same point on the surface. This means they appear stationary relative to ground-based receivers. This fixed position allows for continuous communication links without the need for tracking systems, making them ideal for television broadcasting, telephone communications, and internet services.

8. Describe how the Moon is thought to have formed. (3 marks)  
   **Answer:** The Moon formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago from debris created when a Mars-sized body called Theia collided with the early Earth. The impact ejected material into orbit around Earth, which eventually coalesced to form the Moon. This giant impact hypothesis explains why the Moon has a similar composition to Earth's mantle and why Earth has a relatively large Moon compared to its size.

## Maths/Calculation Questions

1. Calculate the gravitational force between two objects with masses of 5.0 × 10³ kg and 2.0 × 10⁴ kg separated by a distance of 10 m. (Take G = 6.67 × 10⁻¹¹ N m² kg⁻²) (3 marks)  
   **Answer:** F = G × m₁ × m₂ / r² = (6.67 × 10⁻¹¹) × (5.0 × 10³) × (2.0 × 10⁴) / (10)² = 6.67 × 10⁻⁶ N

2. A satellite orbits Earth at a height of 200 km above the surface. Calculate its orbital speed if Earth's radius is 6.4 × 10⁶ m and the gravitational field strength at this distance is approximately 9.0 N/kg. (3 marks)  
   **Answer:** Orbital radius r = Earth's radius + height = 6.4 × 10⁶ + 0.2 × 10⁶ = 6.6 × 10⁶ m  
   Centripetal force = gravitational force: m v² / r = m g  
   v² = g r = 9.0 × 6.6 × 10⁶ = 5.94 × 10⁷  
   v = √(5.94 × 10⁷) = 7.7 × 10³ m/s or 7.7 km/s

3. The Sun has a mass of 2.0 × 10³⁰ kg. Calculate the gravitational force exerted by the Sun on Earth (mass 6.0 × 10²⁴ kg) at a distance of 1.5 × 10¹¹ m. (Take G = 6.67 × 10⁻¹¹ N m² kg⁻²) (2 marks)  
   **Answer:** F = G × M × m / r² = (6.67 × 10⁻¹¹) × (2.0 × 10³⁰) × (6.0 × 10²⁴) / (1.5 × 10¹¹)² = 3.55 × 10²² N

4. An astronaut has a mass of 80 kg. On Earth they weigh 784 N. Calculate their weight on a planet where the gravitational field strength is 6.5 N/kg. (2 marks)  
   **Answer:** Weight on planet = mass × gravitational field strength = 80 × 6.5 = 520 N

5. The Moon orbits Earth at a distance of 3.8 × 10⁸ m with an orbital period of 27.3 days. Use Kepler's third law to calculate Earth's mass. (Take G = 6.67 × 10⁻¹¹ N m² kg⁻², π = 3.14) (4 marks)  
   **Answer:** Kepler's law: T² = (4π² r³) / (G M)  
   M = (4π² r³) / (G T²)  
   First convert T to seconds: 27.3 days = 27.3 × 24 × 3600 = 2.36 × 10⁶ s  
   M = (4 × (3.14)² × (3.8 × 10⁸)³) / ((6.67 × 10⁻¹¹) × (2.36 × 10⁶)²) = 6.0 × 10²⁴ kg

6. Calculate the escape velocity from a planet with radius 5.0 × 10⁶ m and gravitational field strength of 8.0 N/kg. (2 marks)  
   **Answer:** Escape velocity v = √(2 g r) = √(2 × 8.0 × 5.0 × 10⁶) = √(8.0 × 10⁷) = √8.0 × 10³.⁵ ≈ 2.8 × 10⁴ m/s or 28 km/s

7. A geostationary satellite has an orbital period of 24 hours. Calculate its orbital radius above Earth's surface. (Take Earth's mass = 6.0 × 10²⁴ kg, G = 6.67 × 10⁻¹¹ N m² kg⁻², π = 3.14) (4 marks)  
   **Answer:** T = 24 × 3600 = 8.64 × 10⁴ s  
   From Kepler's law: T² = (4π² r³) / (G M)  
   r³ = (G M T²) / (4π²)  
   r³ = [(6.67 × 10⁻¹¹) × (6.0 × 10²⁴) × (8.64 × 10⁴)²] / (4 × (3.14)²)  
   r³ = 7.56 × 10²⁷ / 39.4 = 1.92 × 10²⁶  
   r = ∛(1.92 × 10²⁶) ≈ 4.22 × 10⁷ m  
   Height above surface = r - Earth's radius ≈ 4.22 × 10⁷ - 6.4 × 10⁶ = 3.58 × 10⁷ m or 35,800 km

8. The gravitational field strength on Jupiter's moon Io is 1.8 N/kg. Calculate the weight of a 70 kg astronaut on Io. (1 mark)  
   **Answer:** Weight = mass × g = 70 × 1.8 = 126 N

## Extended Response Questions (6 marks)

1. Explain the evidence that supports both the Big Bang theory and the idea that the Universe is expanding. (6 marks)  
   **Answer:** The Big Bang theory is supported by several key pieces of evidence. Cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation is electromagnetic radiation left over from the early Universe, detected in all directions and matching predictions for a hot early Universe. The red shift of light from distant galaxies shows that they are moving away from us, with more distant galaxies showing greater red shift, indicating an expanding Universe. The abundance of light elements like hydrogen and helium in the Universe matches predictions from Big Bang nucleosynthesis. Together, these observations support the idea that the Universe began as a hot, dense point 13.8 billion years ago and has been expanding ever since.

2. Describe the life cycle of stars and explain how it differs for stars of different masses. (6 marks)  
   **Answer:** Stars begin as main sequence stars, fusing hydrogen into helium in their cores. The life cycle depends on mass: low-mass stars (like the Sun) spend most time as main sequence stars, then become red giants when hydrogen is depleted, fusing helium into carbon. They end as white dwarfs. High-mass stars evolve faster, becoming red supergiants, then undergo supernova explosions. If the core mass is 1.4-3 solar masses, they form neutron stars; if greater than 3 solar masses, black holes. Massive stars create heavier elements through fusion and distribute them via supernova explosions, enriching the Universe with elements needed for planets and life.

3. Explain the different types of artificial satellites and their uses in modern society. (6 marks)  
   **Answer:** Artificial satellites serve various purposes: communication satellites in geostationary orbit provide television, telephone, and internet services by relaying signals between ground stations. GPS satellites in medium Earth orbit enable precise navigation and timing. Weather satellites in polar orbits monitor weather patterns and climate. Scientific satellites study Earth, space, and astronomical phenomena. Military satellites provide reconnaissance and communication. Remote sensing satellites map Earth's surface for agriculture, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. These satellites have revolutionized global communication, navigation, weather forecasting, and scientific research.

4. Discuss the formation and evolution of our Solar System according to current scientific understanding. (6 marks)  
   **Answer:** The Solar System formed about 4.6 billion years ago from a giant molecular cloud that collapsed due to gravity. As it contracted, conservation of angular momentum caused it to spin faster, forming a disk. The Sun formed at the center from the densest material. Planets formed from the remaining disk through accretion of dust and gas. Inner planets formed from rocky material that could withstand high temperatures near the Sun. Outer planets formed from icy and gaseous material. The asteroid belt represents failed planet formation between Mars and Jupiter. The Solar System has evolved through bombardment by asteroids and comets, volcanic activity, and the development of life on Earth.

5. Explain the role of gravity in the Universe, from the formation of planets to the structure of galaxies. (6 marks)  
   **Answer:** Gravity is the fundamental force shaping the Universe. It caused the collapse of the early Universe's matter into the first stars and galaxies. On planetary scales, gravity holds planets in orbit around stars and moons around planets, maintaining stable solar systems. It shapes planetary geology through tidal forces and volcanic activity. On larger scales, gravity holds stars together in galaxies and galaxies in galaxy clusters. Dark matter's gravitational effects explain the rotation curves of galaxies and the formation of large-scale structures. Gravity drives star formation by pulling gas clouds together and powers stellar evolution through core collapse. Without gravity, the Universe would be a diffuse cloud of particles rather than the structured cosmos we observe.
