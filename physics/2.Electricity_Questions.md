10. What happens to the brightness of bulbs in a series circuit when one bulb is removed? (2 marks)
    **Answer:** The other bulbs go out because the circuit is broken.

## Three and Four Mark Questions

1. Explain why the current is the same in all parts of a series circuit. (3 marks)
   **Answer:** In a series circuit, there is only one path for the current to flow, so the charge has to pass through each component in turn. The rate of flow (current) must be the same everywhere because charge cannot accumulate at any point.

2. Describe the difference between series and parallel circuits in terms of voltage. (4 marks)
   **Answer:** In a series circuit, the total voltage is shared between the components, so the voltage across each component adds up to the total voltage. In a parallel circuit, the voltage across each branch is the same as the total voltage supplied by the source.

3. Explain how a fuse protects an electrical circuit. (3 marks)
   **Answer:** A fuse contains a thin wire that melts if the current becomes too high. This breaks the circuit, preventing overheating and potential fire hazards.

4. Describe what happens when two insulators are rubbed together. (3 marks)
   **Answer:** When two insulators are rubbed together, electrons are transferred from one material to the other, causing one to become negatively charged and the other positively charged. This creates static electricity.

5. Explain why parallel circuits are used in domestic wiring. (4 marks)
   **Answer:** In parallel circuits, each appliance has the full voltage supply, so they can operate independently. If one appliance fails, the others continue to work. Also, the total resistance decreases, allowing more current to flow.

6. Describe the energy transfers in an electrical circuit. (4 marks)
   **Answer:** Electrical energy from the power source is transferred to the components in the circuit. In resistors, electrical energy is converted to heat energy. In motors, it's converted to kinetic energy. In lamps, it's converted to light and heat energy.

7. Explain why the total resistance in a parallel circuit is less than the individual resistances. (3 marks)
   **Answer:** In a parallel circuit, there are multiple paths for current to flow, so the total current is shared between the branches. This means the total resistance is less than any single resistor.

8. Describe the hazards of static electricity. (4 marks)
   **Answer:** Static electricity can cause sparks that may ignite flammable substances. It can damage electronic components by discharging suddenly. In some cases, it can cause shocks to people, though usually harmless.

   **Answer:** 1/R_total = 1/4 + 1/6 = 0.25 + 0.1667 = 0.4167, so R_total = 1/0.4167 ≈ 2.4 Ω

7. Calculate the energy transferred when a 5 A current flows through a 12 V battery for 10 minutes. (4 marks)
   **Answer:** Energy = P × t = (V × I) × t = 12 × 5 × 600 = 36000 J = 36 kJ

8. A kettle uses 2 kW of power. How much energy does it use in 5 minutes? (3 marks)

10. A circuit has three resistors in series: 2 Ω, 3 Ω, and 5 Ω. The current is 2 A. Calculate the total power. (4 marks)
    **Answer:** R_total = 2 + 3 + 5 = 10 Ω, P = I²R = 4 × 10 = 40 W

## Six Mark Questions

1. Explain how electricity is distributed from power stations to homes, including the role of transformers. (6 marks)
   **Answer:** Electricity is generated at power stations and transmitted at high voltage to reduce energy loss due to heating in cables (P = I²R, so lower current means less loss). Step-up transformers increase the voltage for transmission. At substations near homes, step-down transformers reduce the voltage to safe levels for domestic use. This system ensures efficient energy transfer over long distances while maintaining safety.

2. Describe the structure of the National Grid and explain why it's important. (6 marks)
   **Answer:** The National Grid consists of power stations, transmission lines, substations, and distribution networks. Power stations generate electricity, which is transmitted at high voltage through overhead lines and underground cables. Substations contain transformers to change voltage levels. The Grid connects multiple power sources and consumers, allowing electricity to be supplied reliably. It's important because it balances supply and demand, integrates renewable sources, and ensures continuous power availability across the country.

3. Explain the differences between AC and DC electricity and their uses. (6 marks)
   **Answer:** AC (alternating current) changes direction periodically, while DC (direct current) flows in one direction. AC is used in mains electricity because it can be easily transformed to different voltages using transformers, making long-distance transmission efficient. DC is used in batteries and electronic devices because it's easier to store and provides steady voltage. AC is safer for high-power applications, while DC is better for low-voltage electronics. The choice depends on the application requirements.

4. Describe how static electricity is used in photocopiers and explain the process. (6 marks)
   **Answer:** In photocopiers, a drum coated with photoconductive material is charged with static electricity. Light from the document discharges certain areas, creating a pattern of charged and uncharged regions. Toner particles, which are charged, stick to the charged areas on the drum. The toner is then transferred to paper and fused with heat. This process relies on the attraction between opposite charges and the ability of light to discharge static charge, allowing precise reproduction of documents.

5. Explain the advantages and disadvantages of using series circuits in domestic wiring. (6 marks)
   **Answer:** Advantages of series circuits include simplicity and low cost, as they require fewer wires. Disadvantages include that if one component fails, the whole circuit stops working, and voltage is shared unequally. In domestic wiring, parallel circuits are preferred because each appliance gets full voltage and can operate independently. Series circuits are rarely used in homes due to safety concerns and inconvenience. However, they are used in some applications like Christmas tree lights for cost reasons.

6. Describe the energy changes that occur in an electrical appliance and explain efficiency. (6 marks)
   **Answer:** In an electrical appliance, electrical energy from the mains is converted to other forms. For example, in a lamp, electrical energy becomes light and heat; in a motor, it becomes kinetic energy. Efficiency is the ratio of useful energy output to total energy input, expressed as a percentage. For instance, a 60W lamp might only produce 5W of light energy, making it 8.3% efficient. Factors affecting efficiency include design, materials used, and operating conditions. Improving efficiency reduces energy waste and environmental impact.
