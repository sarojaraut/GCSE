2. What is the difference between an atom and an ion?
   **Answer: An atom is neutral with equal protons and electrons; an ion has unequal protons and electrons making it charged.** (2 marks)

## Three and Four Mark Questions

1. Describe the structure of an atom, including the location and properties of its subatomic particles. (3 marks)
   **Answer: The atom has a nucleus containing protons (positive charge, mass 1) and neutrons (neutral, mass 1). Electrons (negative charge, negligible mass) orbit the nucleus in shells.**

2. Explain how Rutherford's gold foil experiment led to the discovery of the nucleus. (4 marks)
   **Answer: Rutherford fired alpha particles at gold foil. Most passed through, but some were deflected back. This showed the atom has a small, dense, positively charged nucleus with mostly empty space around it.**

3. Compare alpha, beta, and gamma radiation in terms of their penetrating power and ionising ability. (4 marks)
   **Answer: Alpha has low penetrating power (stopped by paper) and high ionising ability. Beta has medium penetrating power (stopped by aluminium) and medium ionising ability. Gamma has high penetrating power (requires thick lead) and low ionising ability.**

4. Explain what happens during radioactive decay and why it occurs. (3 marks)
   **Answer: During radioactive decay, unstable nuclei emit radiation to become more stable. This happens because the nucleus has too many or too few neutrons relative to protons, making it unstable.**

5. Describe the difference between nuclear fission and nuclear fusion. (4 marks)
   **Answer: Fission splits heavy nuclei into lighter ones, releasing energy (used in nuclear power plants). Fusion combines light nuclei into heavier ones, releasing energy (occurs in stars). Both release energy from mass conversion.**

## Maths Questions

1. An isotope has 12 protons and 13 neutrons. Calculate its mass number. (1 mark)
   **Answer: Mass number = protons + neutrons = 12 + 13 = 25**

2. A radioactive sample has a half-life of 8 days. If you start with 64g, how much remains after 24 days? (3 marks)
   **Answer: After 8 days: 32g, after 16 days: 16g, after 24 days: 8g**

3. Calculate the atomic number of an element with 20 protons. (1 mark)
   **Answer: Atomic number = 20**

4. A nucleus emits an alpha particle. If the original mass number was 238 and atomic number 92, what are the new values? (2 marks)
   **Answer: Mass number: 238 - 4 = 234, Atomic number: 92 - 2 = 90**

5. The half-life of a substance is 5 years. What fraction remains after 15 years? (2 marks)
   **Answer: After 15 years (3 half-lives): 1/8 remains**

## Six Mark Questions

1. Describe the development of the atomic model from Thomson to Bohr, including key experiments and limitations of each model. (6 marks)
   **Answer: Thomson's plum pudding model (1897) had electrons embedded in positive charge, based on cathode ray experiments. Rutherford's nuclear model (1911) showed a small positive nucleus with orbiting electrons, from gold foil experiment. Bohr's model (1913) had electrons in fixed energy levels, explaining spectral lines. Limitations: Thomson couldn't explain scattering; Rutherford couldn't explain stability; Bohr couldn't explain all spectral lines or electron behavior at quantum level.**

2. Explain how radioactive decay can be used to date rocks and artefacts, including the concept of half-life. (6 marks)
   **Answer: Radioactive decay occurs at a constant rate. Half-life is the time for half the atoms to decay. By measuring the ratio of parent to daughter isotopes in a sample and knowing the half-life, the age can be calculated. For example, carbon-14 dating uses the decay of C-14 in organic materials. The formula is: Age = (half-life Ã— ln(2)) / ln(1 + (daughter/parent)). This method assumes the initial ratio is known and no contamination has occurred.**

3. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using nuclear power as an energy source. (6 marks)
   **Answer: Advantages: Low carbon emissions, high energy density, reliable baseload power. Disadvantages: Radioactive waste disposal problems, high initial costs, risk of accidents (e.g., Chernobyl), nuclear proliferation concerns, decommissioning costs. Nuclear fission provides energy by splitting uranium atoms, producing heat to generate electricity. While it doesn't contribute to climate change, the long-term waste storage and safety issues remain significant challenges.**
