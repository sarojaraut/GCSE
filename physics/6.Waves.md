## Short Answer Questions (1-2 marks)

### Wave Properties
1. State the difference between a transverse wave and a longitudinal wave.
   **Answer:** In a transverse wave, the vibrations are at right angles to the direction of wave travel (e.g. waves on a string). In a longitudinal wave, the vibrations are parallel to the direction of wave travel (e.g. sound waves).

2. Define amplitude and wavelength.
   **Answer:** Amplitude is the maximum displacement of a point on a wave from its rest position. Wavelength is the distance between two identical points on adjacent waves, usually measured from peak to peak.

3. What is the frequency of a wave?
   **Answer:** Frequency is the number of complete waves that pass a point per second, measured in Hertz (Hz).

4. State the wave equation.
   **Answer:** Wave speed = frequency × wavelength, or v = fλ

5. What is the period of a wave?
   **Answer:** The period is the time taken for one complete wave to pass a point, measured in seconds.

### Wave Behaviour
6. Explain what happens to a wave when it is reflected.
   **Answer:** When a wave is reflected, it bounces back from a barrier. The angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.

7. What is refraction?
   **Answer:** Refraction is the change in direction of a wave when it passes from one medium to another of different density.

8. Give two examples of transverse waves.
   **Answer:** Light waves, water waves, electromagnetic waves.

9. Give two examples of longitudinal waves.
   **Answer:** Sound waves, seismic P-waves.

10. Why can sound waves travel through solids, liquids and gases but not through a vacuum?
    **Answer:** Sound waves are mechanical waves that require a medium (matter) to travel through. A vacuum has no particles to vibrate and transfer the energy.

## Medium Answer Questions (3-4 marks)

### Wave Calculations
1. A wave has a frequency of 50 Hz and a wavelength of 2 m. Calculate its speed.
   **Answer:** v = f × λ = 50 × 2 = 100 m/s

2. Light travels at 3 × 10^8 m/s with a wavelength of 600 nm. Calculate its frequency.
   **Answer:** First convert wavelength to metres: 600 nm = 600 × 10^-9 m = 6 × 10^-7 m
   f = v/λ = 3 × 10^8 / 6 × 10^-7 = 5 × 10^14 Hz

3. A sound wave has a frequency of 340 Hz and travels at 340 m/s. What is its wavelength?
   **Answer:** λ = v/f = 340/340 = 1 m

4. Calculate the period of a wave with frequency 20 Hz.
   **Answer:** T = 1/f = 1/20 = 0.05 s

### Wave Behaviour
5. Explain why waves diffract more when the gap is similar in size to the wavelength.
   **Answer:** Diffraction occurs when waves spread out after passing through a gap or around an obstacle. The amount of diffraction depends on the size of the gap compared to the wavelength. When the gap is similar in size to the wavelength, significant diffraction occurs as the wave bends around the edges. If the gap is much larger than the wavelength, there is minimal diffraction.

6. Describe what happens when light passes from air into glass.
   **Answer:** When light passes from air into glass, it slows down and bends towards the normal. This is because glass is denser than air, so the wave speed decreases in the glass, causing refraction towards the normal.

7. Explain why different colours of light are refracted by different amounts.
   **Answer:** Different colours of light have different wavelengths. Red light has a longer wavelength than blue light. When white light enters a prism, each colour is refracted by a different amount because the refractive index depends on wavelength. Blue light is refracted more than red light.

8. Describe the difference between reflection and refraction.
   **Answer:** Reflection occurs when a wave bounces back from a surface, following the law of reflection (angle of incidence = angle of reflection). Refraction occurs when a wave changes direction as it passes from one medium to another of different density, following Snell's law.

## Extended Answer Questions (6 marks)

1. Describe the properties of electromagnetic waves and explain how they differ from mechanical waves. (6 marks)
   **Answer:** Electromagnetic waves are transverse waves that can travel through a vacuum and do not require a medium. They consist of oscillating electric and magnetic fields at right angles to each other and to the direction of travel. They all travel at the speed of light (3 × 10^8 m/s) in a vacuum.

   Mechanical waves, such as sound waves, require a medium to travel through and cannot travel through a vacuum. They involve the vibration of particles in the medium. Transverse mechanical waves (like water waves) have vibrations perpendicular to the direction of travel, while longitudinal waves (like sound) have vibrations parallel to the direction of travel.

   Electromagnetic waves transfer energy through the electromagnetic field, while mechanical waves transfer energy through the vibration of particles in a medium. Electromagnetic waves include radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays and gamma rays, arranged in order of increasing frequency and decreasing wavelength.

2. Explain the behaviour of waves at boundaries, including reflection, refraction and diffraction. Use examples to illustrate your answer. (6 marks)
   **Answer:** When waves meet a boundary, they can be reflected, refracted or diffracted.

   Reflection occurs when waves bounce back from a surface. For example, light reflects off a mirror following the law of reflection: angle of incidence equals angle of reflection. Sound waves reflect off walls creating echoes.

   Refraction happens when waves change direction as they pass from one medium to another. For example, when light passes from air to glass, it slows down and bends towards the normal because glass is denser. This is why a straw in water appears bent.

   Diffraction is the spreading out of waves when they pass through a gap or around an obstacle. The amount of diffraction depends on the wavelength compared to the size of the gap. For example, sound waves diffract around corners, which is why you can hear someone speaking around a corner, but light waves do not diffract significantly around everyday objects.

   These behaviours are important in many applications, such as lenses in cameras (refraction), mirrors in telescopes (reflection), and radio wave transmission around obstacles (diffraction).

3. Describe the uses of different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum and explain why particular waves are used for specific applications. (6 marks)
   **Answer:** The electromagnetic spectrum includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays and gamma rays, arranged in order of increasing frequency.

   Radio waves have long wavelengths and low frequencies. They are used for communication because they can diffract around obstacles and travel long distances. AM and FM radio, television broadcasting, and mobile phone signals all use radio waves.

   Microwaves have shorter wavelengths than radio waves. They are used in microwave ovens to heat food by causing water molecules to vibrate. They are also used in satellite communication and radar systems.

   Infrared waves are used in remote controls, thermal imaging cameras (detecting heat), and fibre optic communications. They are absorbed by many materials, making them useful for heating applications.

   Visible light is used for vision and in optical instruments like microscopes and telescopes. Different colours have different wavelengths, which is why prisms can separate white light into a spectrum.

   Ultraviolet waves have higher frequencies than visible light. They are used in fluorescent lamps, sunbeds, and sterilisation. They can damage skin and eyes, causing sunburn.

   X-rays have very short wavelengths and high frequencies. They can penetrate soft tissues but are absorbed by denser materials like bones. This makes them useful in medical imaging and airport security scanners.

   Gamma rays have the shortest wavelengths and highest frequencies. They are used in medical treatments for cancer (radiotherapy) and in sterilising medical equipment. They are highly penetrating and can damage living cells.

4. Explain how the properties of sound waves make them useful for different applications. (6 marks)
   **Answer:** Sound waves are longitudinal mechanical waves that require a medium to travel through. They have several important properties that make them useful in various applications.

   Frequency determines the pitch of sound. Low frequency sounds have low pitch (like thunder), while high frequency sounds have high pitch (like a whistle). Ultrasound uses very high frequency sound waves (above 20,000 Hz) that humans cannot hear. It is used in medical imaging to create pictures of internal body structures, such as unborn babies in pregnancy scans.

   Amplitude determines the loudness of sound. The greater the amplitude, the louder the sound. Sound waves can be reflected (echoes), refracted, and diffracted. These properties are used in sonar systems, where sound waves are sent out and their echoes are detected to determine the distance and shape of underwater objects. Ships use sonar for navigation and detecting submarines.

   The fact that sound waves travel at different speeds in different media is also useful. Sound travels faster in solids than in liquids, and faster in liquids than in gases. This property is used in seismology to study earthquakes - P-waves (longitudinal) travel faster than S-waves (transverse) through solids.

   Sound waves can be absorbed or transmitted through different materials. This is important in architectural acoustics - designing concert halls with materials that absorb unwanted echoes, or using acoustic insulation in buildings to reduce noise transmission.

   Overall, the properties of sound waves make them invaluable for communication, medical diagnosis, navigation, and scientific research.
