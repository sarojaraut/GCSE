## Three and Four Mark Questions

### Question 1 (3 marks)
A car of mass 1000 kg accelerates from rest to 20 m/s in 10 seconds. Calculate the resultant force acting on the car.  

**Answer:**  
Acceleration = (20 - 0) / 10 = 2 m/s²  
Force = mass × acceleration = 1000 × 2 = 2000 N

### Question 2 (4 marks)
Explain why a skydiver reaches terminal velocity.  

**Answer:**  
As the skydiver falls, air resistance increases with speed.  
Initially, weight > air resistance, so acceleration occurs.  
As speed increases, air resistance increases until it equals weight.  
When weight = air resistance, resultant force = 0, so constant velocity (terminal velocity).

### Question 3 (3 marks)
A spring has a spring constant of 200 N/m. Calculate the extension when a force of 50 N is applied.  

**Answer:**  
F = kx  
50 = 200x  
x = 50/200 = 0.25 m

### Question 4 (4 marks)
Describe the forces acting on a car travelling at constant speed on a straight road.  

**Answer:**  
Driving force forwards from engine.  
Air resistance and friction opposing motion.  
Weight downwards and normal contact force upwards from road.  
At constant speed, driving force = air resistance + friction (resultant force = 0).

### Question 5 (3 marks)
Calculate the pressure exerted by a force of 1000 N on an area of 0.5 m².  

**Answer:**  
Pressure = Force / Area = 1000 / 0.5 = 2000 Pa

### Question 6 (4 marks)
Explain how stopping distance is affected by speed.  

**Answer:**  
Stopping distance = thinking distance + braking distance.  
Thinking distance increases with speed (longer to react).  
Braking distance increases with square of speed (kinetic energy increases with v²).  
Higher speed means longer stopping distance.

### Question 7 (3 marks)
A lever has a pivot 0.5 m from a load of 200 N. Calculate the effort needed if the effort is 2 m from the pivot.  

**Answer:**  
Moment of load = 200 × 0.5 = 100 Nm  
For balance, moment of effort = 100 Nm  
Effort × 2 = 100  
Effort = 100 / 2 = 50 N

### Question 8 (4 marks)
Describe the motion of an object thrown upwards.  

**Answer:**  
Initially accelerates upwards due to resultant force (throw - weight).  
As it rises, speed decreases to zero at maximum height.  
Then falls back down, speed increasing.  
Acceleration constant at 9.8 m/s² downwards throughout (gravity).

### Question 5 (4 marks)
A force of 50 N is applied to an area of 0.2 m². Calculate the pressure in kPa.

## Six Mark Questions

### Question 1 (6 marks)

a) Calculate the weight of the skydiver. (2 marks)  
b) Calculate the resultant force initially. (2 marks)  
c) Calculate the initial acceleration. (2 marks)  
(Take g = 10 N/kg)  

**Answer:**  
a) Weight = m × g = 70 × 10 = 700 N  
b) Resultant force = weight - air resistance = 700 - 50 = 650 N downwards  
c) Acceleration = resultant force / mass = 650 / 70 = 9.29 m/s² downwards

### Question 2 (6 marks)
Explain how the forces acting on a car change as it accelerates from rest to a constant speed.  

**Answer:**  
Initially at rest: weight balanced by normal contact force. No horizontal forces.  
When accelerating: engine provides driving force forwards. Friction and air resistance oppose motion.  
Driving force > opposing forces, so resultant force forwards, acceleration occurs.  
As speed increases, air resistance increases.  
Eventually, driving force = air resistance + friction.  
Resultant force = 0, constant speed reached.  
Throughout: weight and normal contact force balanced vertically.

### Question 3 (6 marks)

a) Calculate the extension at 50 N. (2 marks)  
b) What happens if the force is increased to 60 N? (2 marks)  
c) Explain why this happens. (2 marks)  

**Answer:**  
a) F = kx, 50 = 100x, x = 0.5 m  
b) The spring will not obey Hooke's Law; extension will be more than expected.  
c) The elastic limit has been exceeded. The spring has been permanently deformed.

### Question 4 (6 marks)
Describe and explain the motion of a ball thrown horizontally from the top of a cliff.  

**Answer:**  
Horizontally: constant velocity (no horizontal forces).  
Vertically: accelerates downwards at 9.8 m/s² due to gravity.  
Resultant motion: parabolic path.  
Horizontal distance = horizontal velocity × time.  
Vertical distance = ½gt².  
Air resistance affects both components but gravity dominates vertical motion.  
At any time, vertical velocity increases, horizontal remains constant.

### Question 5 (6 marks)
Explain why a cyclist uses different gears when cycling up a hill compared to on flat ground.  

**Answer:**  
On flat ground: balanced forces, constant speed with small driving force.  
Up hill: gravity provides additional opposing force.  
Increased resistance means larger driving force needed.  
Lower gear provides mechanical advantage - smaller force on pedals for same output.  
Lower gear: force on chain increases, torque increases.  
Allows cyclist to maintain speed with increased effort.  
Higher gear on flat ground for efficiency at higher speeds.

### Question 6 (6 marks)
A car has a mass of 1500 kg and is travelling at 20 m/s. The braking force is 6000 N.  
a) Calculate the deceleration. (2 marks)  
b) Calculate the stopping distance. (2 marks)  
c) Explain why thinking distance is important. (2 marks)  

**Answer:**  
a) F = m × a, 6000 = 1500 × a, a = 4 m/s² deceleration  
b) v² = u² + 2as, 0 = 400 + 2×(-4)×s, s = 400 / 8 = 50 m  
c) Thinking distance is the distance travelled during reaction time. Even with good brakes, if driver doesn't react quickly, collision can occur. Factors like tiredness, alcohol, speed affect thinking distance.

### Question 7 (6 marks)
Explain the difference between distance-time and velocity-time graphs for an object moving with constant acceleration.  

**Answer:**  
Distance-time graph: straight line with positive gradient (speed).  
Gradient = speed.  
For constant acceleration: curve, gradient increases with time.  
Velocity-time graph: straight line with constant gradient (acceleration).  
Gradient = acceleration.  
Area under velocity-time graph = distance travelled.  
Distance-time: s = ut + ½at² (parabolic).  
Velocity-time: v = u + at (linear).  
Both show same motion but different aspects.

### Question 8 (6 marks)

a) Calculate the thrust. (2 marks)  
b) Calculate the acceleration initially. (2 marks)  
c) Explain why the mass decreases. (2 marks)  

**Answer:**  
a) Thrust = m × v = 10 × 500 = 5000 N  
b) Acceleration = thrust / mass = 5000 / 1000 = 5 m/s²  
c) As fuel is burned and expelled, the mass of the rocket decreases. This means for the same thrust, acceleration increases as mass decreases (F = ma, smaller m means larger a).
