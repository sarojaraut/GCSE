## Three and Four Mark Questions

1. Explain the differences between the three states of matter in terms of particle arrangement, movement, and forces. (4 marks)
   **Answer: In solids, particles are closely packed in a regular arrangement, vibrate in fixed positions with strong forces between them. In liquids, particles are close together but randomly arranged, can slide past each other with weaker forces. In gases, particles are far apart and randomly arranged, move quickly in all directions with very weak forces.**

2. Describe what happens to the particles during boiling. (3 marks)
   **Answer: Particles gain energy and move faster. The forces between particles are overcome, and particles break away from the liquid to form a gas. The temperature stays constant during boiling.**

3. Explain why cooling a gas decreases its pressure. (3 marks)
   **Answer: When a gas is cooled, particles lose kinetic energy and move slower. They hit the walls less frequently and with less force, so the pressure decreases.**

4. Calculate the density of a substance with mass 50g and volume 10cm³. (3 marks)
   **Answer: Density = mass / volume = 50g / 10cm³ = 5 g/cm³**

5. Explain how the particle model explains diffusion. (4 marks)
   **Answer: Diffusion is the spreading out of particles from an area of high concentration to low concentration. Particles are in constant random motion and collide with each other. In gases and liquids, particles can move freely, so they spread out until evenly distributed.**

6. Describe the changes in internal energy during a change of state. (3 marks)
   **Answer: During melting or boiling, internal energy increases as particles gain kinetic energy. During freezing or condensing, internal energy decreases as particles lose kinetic energy. Temperature remains constant during changes of state.**

7. Explain why liquids have a fixed volume but no fixed shape. (3 marks)
   **Answer: Particles in liquids are close together, so the volume is fixed. However, they can slide past each other, so the shape can change to fit the container.**

8. What factors affect the pressure of a gas? (4 marks)
   **Answer: Number of particles (more particles = higher pressure), temperature (higher temperature = higher pressure), volume (smaller volume = higher pressure), and force of collisions.**

5. The pressure in a container is 50,000 Pa when the volume is 2m³. What is the pressure if the volume is reduced to 1m³ at constant temperature? (3 marks)

6. A balloon contains 0.5 moles of gas at 25°C and 1 atm pressure. If the temperature increases to 50°C, what is the new pressure? (Use P1/T1 = P2/T2) (4 marks)
   **Answer: T1 = 298K, T2 = 323K, P2 = P1 × T2/T1 = 1 × 323/298 ≈ 1.08 atm**

## Six Mark Questions

1. Explain how the particle model accounts for the properties of solids, liquids, and gases. Use examples to illustrate your answer. (6 marks)
   **Answer: The particle model explains that all matter consists of tiny particles in constant motion. In solids, particles are closely packed in a regular arrangement, held by strong forces, explaining fixed shape and volume. For example, a metal spoon keeps its shape. In liquids, particles are close but randomly arranged with weaker forces, explaining fixed volume but changeable shape, like water taking the shape of its container. In gases, particles are far apart with very weak forces, explaining compressibility and ability to fill any space, like air filling a room. The model also explains expansion on heating as particles gain energy and move faster, increasing spaces between them.**

2. Describe the processes of evaporation and boiling, explaining the differences between them using the particle model. (6 marks)
   **Answer: Both evaporation and boiling involve particles gaining energy to become a gas. In evaporation, particles at the surface gain enough energy to overcome forces and escape, happening at any temperature below boiling point. It's a surface phenomenon. In boiling, particles throughout the liquid gain energy until they overcome forces and form bubbles, happening at a specific temperature (boiling point). During boiling, temperature remains constant as energy is used to break bonds rather than increase kinetic energy. Evaporation is slower and cools the liquid, while boiling is faster and maintains temperature. The particle model shows that more energetic particles escape, leaving less energetic ones behind.**

3. Explain how changes in temperature and pressure affect the state of matter, using the particle model. (6 marks)
   **Answer: Temperature affects particle energy: higher temperature means more kinetic energy, particles move faster. This can cause melting (solid to liquid) or boiling (liquid to gas) as particles overcome forces. Lower temperature reduces energy, causing freezing or condensing. Pressure affects spacing: higher pressure pushes particles closer, favoring denser states like gas to liquid. Lower pressure allows expansion. For example, increasing pressure on a gas can liquefy it (like in refrigerators). The particle model shows these as changes in particle arrangement, movement, and forces between particles. Internal energy changes during these processes, with temperature constant during changes of state.**

4. Discuss the limitations of the particle model and how it explains density differences between substances. (6 marks)
   **Answer: The particle model assumes particles are solid spheres with no volume, which isn't entirely accurate as particles have size. It doesn't explain quantum effects or forces in detail. However, it successfully explains density: density = mass/volume. Substances with heavier particles or closer packing have higher density. For example, lead has high density due to heavy atoms closely packed. Gases have low density due to large spaces between light particles. The model explains why density changes with temperature (expansion increases volume, decreases density) and pressure (compression decreases volume, increases density). It also explains why some solids float on liquids (lower density) and why gases are compressible.**

5. Using the particle model, explain why gases exert pressure and how this relates to the kinetic theory. (6 marks)
   **Answer: Gases exert pressure because particles are in constant random motion, colliding with container walls. Each collision exerts a force; pressure is force per unit area. More frequent or forceful collisions increase pressure. Kinetic theory states gas pressure depends on particle speed and number. Faster particles (higher temperature) hit walls harder and more often. More particles increase collision frequency. The model explains Boyle's law (pressure ∝ 1/volume at constant temperature) as reduced volume increases collision frequency. It also explains Charles's law (pressure ∝ temperature at constant volume) as increased temperature increases particle speed and collision force. This explains gas behavior in engines, balloons, and weather systems.**
