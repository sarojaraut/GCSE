# Structure of the atom

The modern view of the atom is of a nucleus containing protons and neutrons with smaller electrons orbiting outside the nucleus.

Protons and neutrons are the heaviest particles in an atom and as a result they make up most of the mass of the atom.

The number of protons is what defines the element
The total number of protons and neutrons is called the mass number and the number of protons is called the atomic number

An element's atomic number defines it. An element with 17 protons will always be chlorine.However an element's mass numbers can vary, which means that it can have different numbers of neutrons.
So although chlorine has a mass number of 35 which means it has 18 neutrons, it can also have a mass number of 37, which means it has 20 neutrons.

The different types of chlorine are called isotopes.

Isotopes are forms of an element that have the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons.

There are three isotopes of hydrogen: hydrogen, deuterium (hydrogen-2) and tritium (hydrogen-3):

# Ions
Normally, atoms are neutral. They have the same number of protons in the nucleus as they have electrons orbiting in the energy levels around the nucleus.

Atoms can, however, lose or gain electrons due to collisions or other interactions.

if the atom loses one or more electrons, it becomes a positively-charged ion
if the atom gains one or more electrons, it becomes a negatively-charged ion
