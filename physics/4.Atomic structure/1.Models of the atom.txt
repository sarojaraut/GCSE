In ancient Greece, most people thought that matter was made up of combinations of four elements: earth, air, fire and water.

After discovering the electron in 1897, J J Thomson proposed that the atom looked like a plum pudding : atom consisted of positive 'dough' with a lot of negative
electrons stuck in it. This was consistent with the evidence available at the time

solids cannot be squashed, therefore the atoms which make them up must be solid throughout
rubbing two solids together often results in static charge so there must be something (electrons) on the outsides of atoms which can be transferred as atoms collide

# Rutherford and the nucleus
In 1905, Ernest Rutherford did an experiment to test the plum pudding model. directed a beam of alpha particles at a very thin gold leaf suspended in a vacuum.

The vacuum is to ensure that any deflection of the alpha particles would only be because of collisions with the gold foil and not due to deflections off anything else.

Rutherford considered the observations and he concluded:

the fact that most alpha particles went straight through the foil is evidence for the atom being mostly empty space

a small number of alpha particles being deflected at large angles suggested that there is a concentration of positive charge in the atom - like charges repel, so the positive alpha particles were being repelled by positive charges

the very small number of alpha particles coming straight back suggested that the positive charge and mass are concentrated in a tiny volume in the atom (the nucleus) - the tiny number doing this means the chance of being on that exact collision course was very small, and so the 'target' being aimed at had to be equally tiny

Rutherford had discovered the nuclear atom, a small, positively-charged nucleus surrounded by empty space and then a layer of electrons to form the outside of the atom.

# Bohr and energy levels

Even though Rutherford had proven the existence of the nucleus, scientists were unsure how electrons fitted into this new model.

In 1913, Niels Bohr revised Rutherford's model by suggesting that the electrons orbited the nucleus in different energy levels or at specific distances from the nucleus.

By doing this, he was able to explain that since particular chemicals burn with certain-coloured flames, the pattern of energy released by electrons in the chemical reaction must be the same for every single atom of that element.

# Chadwick and the neutron
The proton had been proposed as being the nuclear particle responsible for the positive charge of the nucleus and for some of the nuclear mass. However, there was still a difference between the atomic number of the atom and the atomic mass.
Bohr and other scientists knew that there also had to be a neutral particle the same size as a proton to keep the nucleus stable and to make up the mass.

# 1932 that James Chadwick was able to prove its existence.

Chadwick used a version of Rutherford's experiment, using a sheet of beryllium and a paraffin block instead of gold foil. He was able to prove that a proton-sized neutral particle - now known as the neutron - existed.
