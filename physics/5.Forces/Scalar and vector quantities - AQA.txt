#Scalar and vector quantities - AQA

A physical quantity is something that can be measured. Scalar quantities only have a magnitude or size.

Examples of scalar quantities : Temprature, mass, speed, length, volume, distance, energy, density etc
Scalers can be added sutracted like standard numerical operations

Vector quantities have both magnitude and an associated direction, unlike scalar quantities, which just have magnitude.

Examples of vector quantities : Velocity, displacement, force, acceleration, momentum
