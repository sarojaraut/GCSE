Gradient of a straight line is a measure of the steepness
    The calculation is the "change in y" divided by the "change in x". 
    A positive gradient means the line is increasing from left to right. 
    A negative gradient means the line is decreasing from left to right. 

    It can refer to the rate at which a quantity like temperature, pressure, or concentration changes over a distance. 



Gradient of a curve
    we can draw tangents at a point on curve and calculate tangents slope or use differentiation

    Differentiation is used to find the gradient of a tangent to a curve.
    While the gradient of a straight line is constant, for a curve, the gradient is always changing.
    The gradient of a curve at a given point is defined as being the gradient of the tangent at that point.
    The function that tells us the gradient of the tangent and curve at the given point is called the derivative.
    The formal technique for finding the gradient of a tangent is known as differentiation from first principles and is written as:
    f`(x)  = [ f (x + h) - f (x) ] /h [ as  (x+h)-x = h], 
        where h is the horizontal distance between two points on the curve and has a limit tending to zero.

    Using differentiation from first principles, differentiate f(x) = x**2 
        => F`(x)  = [(x+h)**2 - x**2]/h 
                    = 2x + h As h tends to zero, the derivative f`(x)=2x

    Differentiation is used in maths for calculating rates of change.

    For example in mechanics, the rate of change of displacement (with respect to time) is the velocity.
    The rate of change of velocity (with respect to time) is the acceleration.

    differentiating y with respect to x is written as dy/dx. This is also known as 'Leibniz Notation'.

    There are many ways a question can ask you to differentiate:
        Differentiate the function...
        Find F`(x)
        Find dy/dx
        Calculate the rate of change of...
        Find the derivative of…
        Calculate the gradient of the tangent to the curve...

    f(x) = a*x**n : f`(x) = a*n*x**n-1
    y=sinx : dy/dx = cosx
    y=cosx : dy/dx = -sinx

    The chain rule: The chain rule is used to differentiate composite functions. It is written as:
        dy/dx = dy/du * du/dx
        e.g Differentiate y=(2x+4)**3
        using chain rule we can rewrite : y=u**3 and u=2x+4 
        dy/dx = dy/du * du/dx = 3u**2 * 2 = 6u**2 = 6(2x+4)**2

        y=(sin2x)**2 
        y = u**2
        dy/du = 2u = 2sin2x
        du/dx = 2cos2x (another chain rule)
        dy/dx = 4sin2X*cos2X

        expression might need expanding or dividing before dy/dx can be found out

Equation of a tangent and normals
    We can calculate the gradient of a tangent to a curve by differentiating.
    In order to find the equation of a tangent, we:

    Differentiate the equation of the curve
    Substitute the value into the differentiated equation to find the gradient
    Substitute the value into the original equation of the curve to find the y-coordinate
    Substitute your point on the line and the gradient into y-b=m(x-a)

    **for normals m1*m2 = -1
    **how to find out if a line passes through original

    **Increasing or decreasing function if dy/dx > 0 then increasing and dy/dx < 0 then decreasing
    Some functions are increasing or decreasing in the whole domain or some are in parts

    **Second derevetive

        d/dx(dy/dx) = d**2y/d**2x = f``(x)

    ** Stationary points in a curve is a point where gradient of the tangent is 0, i.e where tangent is horizontal
    Maximum point where dy/dx=0 and gradient is positive to the left and negetive to the right
    Minimum point where dy/dx=0 and gradient is negative to the left and positive to the right

    One way is finding the stationary point where dy/dx expression is 0 and then choose an x value 1 less than stationaty point(x value) and an x value 1 more than stationaty point(x value)
    And observe the dy/dx sign change for those two points
    
    Another method is finding the second derivative
    d**2/d**y = rate of change of dy/dx
        d**2/d**y > 0 then gradient must go from -ve to +ve , os it's minimum turning point
        d**2/d**y < 0 then gradient must go from =ve to -ve , os it's maximum turning point

    Application of maxima and minima

    Y = c => dy/dx=0
    y = f(x) + g(x) => dy/dx = f`(x) + g`(x)
    gradient of tangent = dy/dx = m
    gradient of tangent = -1/m where m = dy/dx
    Stationary point is where dy/dx=0
    f(x) is increasing at a point if dy/dx >0
    f(x) is decreasing at a point if dy/dx <0
    Nature of stationary point can be determined by looking at the sign of gradient at either side of stationary point
    d**2/d**y is an alternative way of finding minima or maxima
        d**2/d**y > 0 then gradient must go from -ve to +ve , os it's minimum turning point
        d**2/d**y < 0 then gradient must go from =ve to -ve , os it's maximum turning point
