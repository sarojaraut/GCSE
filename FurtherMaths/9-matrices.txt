A matrix is a rectangular grid (array) of elements (numbers or letters) arranged in rows and columns
The order of a matrix is its "number of rows" × "number of columns"
a 2 × 2 matrix representing number of male and female students in two tutor group 
                male   female
tutor group A ( 8        6)
tutor group B ( 7        9)

Note : Should have been one pair of brackeet instead of two separate bracket

Multiply matrix by scalar : simply multiply each element by scalar : So order remains the same

Adding matrices (if order is same) just add correpsonding elements

Matrix multiplication : Number of columns in first matrix should be same as number fo rows in second matrix
Multiply the elements of the first row of the first matrix with corresponding element of first of column of second matrix and add them up
Final order of matrix will be : number of rows of first matrix and number of columns of second matrix
if a 2x3 matrix is multiplied with 3x2 matrix the result will be 2x2  matrix

Zero matrix if all elements are 0, can be of any order
Identity matrix : always a square matrix and  diagonal elemnts from top left to bottom right are 1 and everything else is 0
